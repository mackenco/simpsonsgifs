<i>The Simpsons</i>

2
00:00:15,415 --> 00:00:17,508
D'oh!

3
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:44,909
Oh, all these new superheroes suck.

4
00:00:45,011 --> 00:00:47,070
<i>None of them could hold a candle
to Radioactive Man.</i>

5
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:50,411
<i>The only decent new one
is Radiation Dude.</i>

6
00:00:50,517 --> 00:00:53,145
- He's a cheap imitation of Radioactive Man.
- Explain.

7
00:00:53,253 --> 00:00:55,915
The similarities are subtle, but many.

8
00:00:56,022 --> 00:01:00,015
For example, Radioactive Man has
his famous catchphrase, "Up and Atom!"

9
00:01:00,126 --> 00:01:03,027
With "at 'em" spelled
A-T-O-M, in a delicious pun.

10
00:01:03,129 --> 00:01:06,724
- Go on.
- While Radiation Dude has a similar...

11
00:01:06,833 --> 00:01:09,802
but lamer catchphrase,
"Up and let's go!"

12
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:12,394
So you kids fancy
yourselves experts, eh?

13
00:01:12,505 --> 00:01:16,908
<i>Well, between us we've read
all 814 issues of Radioactive Man.</i>

14
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:19,570
Yeah, and we both have a special,
limited-edition issue...

15
00:01:19,679 --> 00:01:22,375
where he and Fallout Boy
get killed on every page.

16
00:01:22,482 --> 00:01:24,643
I suppose you know then,
that Hollywood is planning...

17
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:26,719
a feature film
about Radioactive Man.

18
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:28,720
I have got to do something...

19
00:01:28,822 --> 00:01:30,722
<i>about that
air conditioner suction.</i>

20
00:01:30,824 --> 00:01:32,815
Who's gonna play Radioactive Man?

21
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:36,089
I will tell you in
exactly seven minutes.

22
00:01:40,333 --> 00:01:44,667
<i>Okay. Here we are.
Alt dot nerd dot obsessive.</i>

23
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:48,263
Need know star R.M. pic.

24
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:07,423
Yeah, I don't see why Rainier Wolfcastle
should be the star.

25
00:02:07,527 --> 00:02:10,189
I think we should
bring back Dirk Richter.

26
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:13,390
Kids will want to see
the original Radioactive Man.

27
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:17,596
I keep telling you,
he's 73 years old and he's dead.

28
00:02:17,704 --> 00:02:20,468
- Granted, but-
- Besides, we want to stay as far away from...

29
00:02:20,573 --> 00:02:22,700
the campy '70s version as possible.

30
00:02:24,444 --> 00:02:26,503
Billowing backpacks,
Radioactive Man!

31
00:02:26,613 --> 00:02:30,344
It's the worst villain of them all!
The Scoutmaster!

32
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:33,908
- I see him, Fallout Boy.
- Go get 'em, Scouts.

33
00:02:42,395 --> 00:02:46,388
Don't be afraid to use your nails, boys!

34
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:12,821
So, where can we shoot this picture?

35
00:03:12,926 --> 00:03:15,895
We need a city that has
a nuclear reactor and a gorge...

36
00:03:15,995 --> 00:03:18,987
and can guarantee us the full cooperation
of city officials.

37
00:03:19,098 --> 00:03:21,328
<i>I'll check Variety.</i>

38
00:03:24,103 --> 00:03:26,094
<i>Wow. Look at that ad.</i>

39
00:03:28,408 --> 00:03:31,104
All right, this place must be hot.
They don't need a big ad...

40
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:33,805
- or even correct spelling.
- I agree with that logic.

41
00:03:33,913 --> 00:03:36,711
Get me two plane tickets
to the state that Springfield is in.

42
00:03:38,818 --> 00:03:41,412
Right. We have $30 million to spend.

43
00:03:41,521 --> 00:03:44,115
We'll blow up our dams,
destroy forests- anything!

44
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:46,692
If there's a species of animal
that's causing you problems...

45
00:03:46,793 --> 00:03:49,318
nosing around your camera,
we'll have it wiped out!

46
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:52,694
Look, we just want to make movies,
not kill things.

47
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,791
Right. We understand.

48
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:58,166
Students, I have an announcement.

49
00:03:58,271 --> 00:04:01,399
One of your favorite
comic book heroes, "Radio Man"-

50
00:04:01,507 --> 00:04:03,304
Radioactive Man, stupid!

51
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:05,934
Strange. I shouldn't have been able to hear that.

52
00:04:06,045 --> 00:04:08,605
Anyway, a Hollywood studio
has decided to film...

53
00:04:08,715 --> 00:04:11,707
<i>the Radioactive Man movie
here in Springfield.</i>

54
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:16,555
<i>And, they will be holding auditions
to find a local youngster...</i>

55
00:04:16,656 --> 00:04:19,216
<i>to play Fallout Boy.</i>

56
00:04:19,325 --> 00:04:21,793
<i>Oh, and the air conditioner
will be fixed this afternoon.</i>

57
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:30,236
Look behind you,
Radioactive Man!

58
00:04:30,336 --> 00:04:32,236
The sun is exploding again!

59
00:04:32,338 --> 00:04:34,738
<i>Bart, why are you
talking like that?</i>

60
00:04:34,841 --> 00:04:37,071
Yeah, and who the hell
are you talkin' to?

61
00:04:37,176 --> 00:04:40,805
Marge, do you have other men
in this house? Radioactive men?

62
00:04:40,913 --> 00:04:43,143
I'm practicing
my Fallout Boy dialogue.

63
00:04:43,249 --> 00:04:45,149
If I get his role,
I could finally come to terms...

64
00:04:45,251 --> 00:04:47,219
with this funny little
muddle called Bart.

65
00:04:58,998 --> 00:05:00,898
Ev-er-y-one is...

66
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,331
talk-ing a-bout...

67
00:05:02,435 --> 00:05:05,370
<i>Ra-di-o-ac-tive M-an...</i>

68
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:07,598
y'all.

69
00:05:07,707 --> 00:05:10,175
Wow! You mean, you were one
of the original Little Rascals?

70
00:05:10,276 --> 00:05:12,972
- Yeah.
- Which one were you? The ugly one?

71
00:05:15,081 --> 00:05:19,484
- Were you the ugly one?
- No, I was the tough kid. Smelly.

72
00:05:19,585 --> 00:05:22,713
My shtick was lookin' into an exhaust pipe
and gettin' a face full of soot.

73
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:24,790
Nobody could do that better than me.

74
00:05:24,891 --> 00:05:26,859
Of course, it was kinda hard
to think of reasons...

75
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:28,927
for me to look in that exhaust pipe
every time...

76
00:05:29,028 --> 00:05:30,928
but, you know,
we had good writers.

77
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:33,965
William Faulkner can write an exhaust pipe
gag that would really make you think.

78
00:05:34,067 --> 00:05:37,696
If you were such a big shot,
why aren't you still makin' movies?

79
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:41,473
Moe? Moe!

80
00:05:45,812 --> 00:05:47,780
- Oh, no! My favorite aggie!
- Oh!

81
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,745
Ha?

82
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:52,181
Hmm? Oh.

83
00:05:52,285 --> 00:05:55,448
<i>You stole my bit! You-That's my bit, you-</i>

84
00:05:55,555 --> 00:05:57,489
Oh, you stole my bit!

85
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:59,558
<i>Cut.! Oh, my God.!</i>

86
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:01,957
He's killed the original Alfalfa!

87
00:06:02,061 --> 00:06:05,360
Yeah. Luckily, Alfalfa was an orphan,
owned by the studio.

88
00:06:05,465 --> 00:06:07,524
- Oh, I see.
- Yeah. That makes sense.

89
00:06:07,633 --> 00:06:09,863
With wealthy Hollywood
people on the way...

90
00:06:09,969 --> 00:06:13,496
local merchants can be forgiven
for raising their prices a little.

91
00:06:24,951 --> 00:06:27,146
Help me, Radioactive Man.

92
00:06:27,253 --> 00:06:29,653
Watch out, Radioactive Man!

93
00:06:31,758 --> 00:06:34,386
- Totally awesome.
- Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

94
00:06:34,494 --> 00:06:38,157
It's all in the delivery.
"Now is the winter of our discontent"-

95
00:06:38,264 --> 00:06:40,164
Oh, no! Run!

96
00:06:40,266 --> 00:06:43,235
Cool! Yeah.

97
00:06:43,336 --> 00:06:46,669
Mom!
Don't make me do this!

98
00:06:46,773 --> 00:06:51,005
- I don't wanna be an actor.
- Nonsense. You're going to be great.

99
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:55,342
Now take off those glasses,
so they can see your beautiful eyes.

100
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:00,913
At last the world is safe,
eh, Fallout Boy?

101
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,510
- Watch out!
- Next!

102
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:09,023
Ha-ha!
Hey, that hurts.

103
00:07:09,128 --> 00:07:11,995
No wonder no one came
to my birthday party.

104
00:07:13,466 --> 00:07:15,525
At last the world is safe...

105
00:07:15,635 --> 00:07:18,468
- eh, Fallout Boy?
- What's for lunch tomorrow?

106
00:07:18,571 --> 00:07:20,903
- Next.
- Chicken necks?

107
00:07:21,007 --> 00:07:23,339
<i>We're never going to find-Wait a minute.</i>

108
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:27,436
<i>That child has the exact qualities we're
looking for.! He's perfect.! What is his name?</i>

109
00:07:27,547 --> 00:07:29,606
I don't know. He just came
along with one of the others.

110
00:07:29,715 --> 00:07:32,275
- He didn't sign up officially.
- Oh, forget him then.

111
00:07:32,385 --> 00:07:35,946
It wouldn't be fair to the other children
who filled out their application forms in full.

112
00:07:36,055 --> 00:07:38,387
Next!

113
00:07:38,491 --> 00:07:41,949
At last the world is safe,
eh, Fallout Boy?

114
00:07:42,995 --> 00:07:44,929
Watch out, Radioactive Man!

115
00:07:45,031 --> 00:07:49,161
- Brilliant reading. Again?
- Watch out, Radioactive Man!

116
00:07:49,268 --> 00:07:51,202
Fantastic! One more time!

117
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:55,900
- Watch out, Radioactive Man!
- Congratulations, Bart Simpson.

118
00:07:56,008 --> 00:07:57,908
<i>You're our new Fallout Boy.!</i>

119
00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:00,979
That's what I'd be saying to you
if you weren't an inch too short. Next!

120
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:09,678
I've got to grow an inch by tomorrow,
or I won't get that part.

121
00:08:09,789 --> 00:08:12,952
Pull, you mighty stallions,
pull! Show me no mercy!

122
00:08:17,063 --> 00:08:18,724
Oh!

123
00:08:29,408 --> 00:08:32,900
Oh, I only grew half an inch.
I'm still too short.

124
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:35,845
Growing half an inch in one day
is still pretty good, Bart.

125
00:08:35,948 --> 00:08:38,109
Yeah, that's how fast
Grampa's shrinking.

126
00:08:38,217 --> 00:08:40,242
Oh, I'm as tall as I ever was.

127
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:43,618
<i>Is there any way I can look taller
without actually being taller?</i>

128
00:08:48,928 --> 00:08:52,261
Good news, gentlemen.
I've grown that extra inch you wanted.

129
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:55,766
- Plus several feet more.
- We found our new Fallout Boy!

130
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:57,529
<i>And he's right over there.</i>

131
00:08:57,637 --> 00:08:58,604
Huh?

132
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:00,695
Ladies and gentlemen...

133
00:09:00,806 --> 00:09:02,706
meet America's new Fallout Boy!

134
00:09:07,747 --> 00:09:10,181
Out of the way. Milhouse, baby!

135
00:09:10,283 --> 00:09:14,219
Lionel Hutz, your new agent, bodyguard,
unauthorized biographer and drug dealer-

136
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,379
uh, keeper-awayer.

137
00:09:19,292 --> 00:09:22,625
Leave me alone! Mom! Dad!

138
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:24,696
Make 'em stop!

139
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:31,361
- What is all this stuff?
- Uh, we've heard you've become a star.

140
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:34,030
We decided we better start
living in the fast lane.

141
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:37,735
What if I'm not a success?
How will you pay for all this?

142
00:09:37,843 --> 00:09:40,334
I'm sorry. I can't hear you, son.

143
00:09:40,446 --> 00:09:42,437
I'm wearing a Jacuzzi suit.

144
00:09:43,449 --> 00:09:45,349
I just missed out...

145
00:09:45,451 --> 00:09:48,477
on the greatest opportunity
of my entire life.

146
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:52,752
George Burns was right.
Show business is a hideous bitch goddess.

147
00:09:52,858 --> 00:09:55,793
Cheer up, Bart. Milhouse is still
gonna need a true friend.

148
00:09:55,895 --> 00:09:58,989
Someone to tell him he's great.
Someone to rub lotion on him.

149
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:01,862
Someone he can hurl whiskey bottles at
when he's feeling low.

150
00:10:01,968 --> 00:10:04,334
You're right, Lise.
I can suck up to him...

151
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:06,371
like the religious people
suck up to God!

152
00:10:06,472 --> 00:10:09,134
Guess what, kids?

153
00:10:09,241 --> 00:10:12,972
They're gonna pay us $50 a day
to film some of the movie here.

154
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:15,570
Ah, we'll run that cable through here.

155
00:10:17,483 --> 00:10:19,747
Careful, now. Hey.

156
00:10:19,852 --> 00:10:22,946
<i>Didn't you direct
Unnatural Discretion?</i>

157
00:10:23,055 --> 00:10:25,114
Well, yes, I did.

158
00:10:25,224 --> 00:10:28,387
Hoo-whee! Whoo! Oh!

159
00:10:28,494 --> 00:10:31,463
You know, I never
walk out of a movie, but, yuck!

160
00:10:31,564 --> 00:10:33,896
I've got an idea, Mr. Simpson.

161
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,764
Why don't you get somethin' to eat
from our food truck?

162
00:10:36,869 --> 00:10:39,394
<i>- Hey.!
- M-Mr. Simpson?</i>

163
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:45,042
You've gotta give me
the part of Krispy the Clown!

164
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:47,135
I'm sorry!
You're wrong for the part.

165
00:10:47,246 --> 00:10:49,612
But look at my range!

166
00:10:54,553 --> 00:10:57,351
I'm sorry. Krispy the Clown
has been cast.

167
00:10:57,456 --> 00:11:01,859
But I will hire you for Angry the Clown,
Silly Sailor and Dr. Clownius.

168
00:11:02,895 --> 00:11:05,193
I won't let you down!

169
00:11:05,297 --> 00:11:07,265
Well, I might let you down
on Silly Sailor.

170
00:11:13,606 --> 00:11:17,007
- Up and atom.
- Up and at them.

171
00:11:17,109 --> 00:11:19,839
- Up and atom!
- Up and at them!

172
00:11:19,945 --> 00:11:21,913
- Up and atom!
- Up and at them!

173
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:23,914
Better.

174
00:11:25,051 --> 00:11:27,281
Hi, Milhouse!
Hey, I want you to know...

175
00:11:27,386 --> 00:11:29,377
that I'm glad at least
one of us got the part.

176
00:11:30,423 --> 00:11:32,391
Milhouse!

177
00:11:32,491 --> 00:11:35,426
I didn't do it.
I wished him well. I wished him well!

178
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:40,124
Stupid dummy wasn't
supposed to explode yet.

179
00:11:40,232 --> 00:11:43,395
<i>There's the real Milhouse.</i>

180
00:11:45,171 --> 00:11:49,164
Milhouse! Hey, you're not Milhouse.

181
00:11:49,275 --> 00:11:52,733
No, I'm just Milhouse
when he gets hurt. Ohh!

182
00:11:52,845 --> 00:11:56,747
Okay. Let's get the real Milhouse
over here, under the X-ray truck.

183
00:11:58,918 --> 00:12:01,443
Hi, Bart.

184
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:05,081
Hey, cool, Milhouse.
You get to be crushed by a truck.

185
00:12:05,191 --> 00:12:07,785
It sounds like more fun
than it really is.

186
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:10,453
Hey! I- I think I'm lying
on a broken bottle!

187
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:14,795
Beautiful! Use it. Okay.
Fallout Boy, origin scene, take one-

188
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,800
<i>Action.!</i>

189
00:12:18,971 --> 00:12:23,032
- Up and at them.
- Thanks for the help, mysterious stranger.

190
00:12:23,142 --> 00:12:26,543
Say. I think those X-rays
gave me super powers.

191
00:12:26,645 --> 00:12:30,809
<i>And... cut.! That was perfect.!
Let's do it again.</i>

192
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:33,976
Uh, these aren't real X-rays, are they?

193
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:35,986
Good question!
We'll check into that.

194
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:39,580
Okay. X-ray machine
to full power, and... action!

195
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:47,289
Uh, sir, why don't you
just use real cows?

196
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:50,266
Cows don't look like cows on film.
You gotta use horses.

197
00:12:50,369 --> 00:12:53,361
What do you do if you want something
that looks like a horse?

198
00:12:53,472 --> 00:12:56,236
Uh, usually we just tape
a bunch of cats together.

199
00:12:56,342 --> 00:12:59,106
- You guys work on the movie?
- You're sayin' we're not working?

200
00:12:59,211 --> 00:13:01,645
Oh, I always wanted
to be a Teamster.

201
00:13:01,747 --> 00:13:03,840
So lazy and surly.

202
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:08,318
Mind if I relax next to ya?

203
00:13:27,573 --> 00:13:29,473
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

204
00:13:29,575 --> 00:13:32,738
Oh, here he comes. What is it now, Quimby?

205
00:13:32,845 --> 00:13:36,406
Nothing. Nothing.
Only the, uh, city has just passed...

206
00:13:36,515 --> 00:13:38,779
another tax on puffy directing pants.

207
00:13:38,884 --> 00:13:41,045
But I don't wear puffy pants!

208
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:44,316
I meant a, uh, tax on
not wearing puffy pants.

209
00:13:44,423 --> 00:13:46,414
- Oy!
- I'm sorry.

210
00:13:51,263 --> 00:13:53,788
Wow! You've really got it
made now, Milhouse.

211
00:13:53,899 --> 00:13:57,096
<i>- This is living!
- Is it, Bart?</i>

212
00:13:57,203 --> 00:13:59,603
- Is it really?
- Yeah.

213
00:13:59,705 --> 00:14:02,799
Ever since I became a movie star,
I've been miserable.

214
00:14:02,908 --> 00:14:05,376
I had to get up at 5:00 a. m.
just for makeup.

215
00:14:05,477 --> 00:14:09,971
I like the way the blush brings out
my cheekbones, but it's not worth it.

216
00:14:10,082 --> 00:14:13,074
And making movies is
so horribly repetitive.

217
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:16,712
I've said "jiminy jillickers" so many times,
the words have lost all meaning.

218
00:14:16,822 --> 00:14:19,723
We've got to do the jiminy jillickers
scene again, Milhouse.

219
00:14:19,825 --> 00:14:24,888
But we already did it.
It took seven hours, but we did it.

220
00:14:24,997 --> 00:14:26,464
It's done.

221
00:14:26,565 --> 00:14:30,023
Yes! But we've got to do it
from different angles.

222
00:14:30,135 --> 00:14:33,002
Again and again!
And again and again and again!

223
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:40,176
Yeah!

224
00:14:43,282 --> 00:14:47,412
Ach! I can't believe
Silly Sailor beat us both up...

225
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:52,149
- and imprisoned us in his floating Aquaworld.
- Jiminy jillickers!

226
00:14:52,258 --> 00:14:57,025
There, now,
there's no need for profanity, Fallout Boy.

227
00:14:57,129 --> 00:15:00,656
Everyone in town has been gouging us
silly, but it's worth it.

228
00:15:00,766 --> 00:15:03,200
- It's all up there on the screen.
- Yes.

229
00:15:03,302 --> 00:15:06,635
<i>That Milhouse is going to be big.!
Gabby Hayes big!</i>

230
00:15:09,808 --> 00:15:11,901
Okay, listen up, everybody.
This is the hardest...

231
00:15:12,011 --> 00:15:15,139
most expensive scene in the movie,
and we only get one shot at it.

232
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:19,183
So we have to do it right.
Fallout Boy will untie Radioactive Man...

233
00:15:19,285 --> 00:15:21,185
and pull him to safety...

234
00:15:21,287 --> 00:15:25,087
moments before he's hit
with a 40-foot wall of sulfuric acid...

235
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:28,091
that will horribly burn
everything in its path.

236
00:15:28,193 --> 00:15:31,492
Now, that's real acid,
so I want to see goggles, people.

237
00:15:32,731 --> 00:15:37,498
- Real acid?
- Okay. Roll film!

238
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:41,095
<i>Tip the acid vats.!
And... action.</i>

239
00:15:45,678 --> 00:15:48,476
Only Fallout Boy can save me now.

240
00:15:50,249 --> 00:15:52,581
Where's Fallout Boy?

241
00:15:55,587 --> 00:15:58,454
- Fallout Boy!
- Uh-oh.

242
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:08,532
My eyes.
The goggles do nothing.

243
00:16:18,277 --> 00:16:20,837
Where in the hell is Milhouse?

244
00:16:20,946 --> 00:16:24,245
That one shot cost us
a million dollars!

245
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:28,514
<i>Where's the producer?
I want to talk about this coffee.</i>

246
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:49,940
Milhouse!

247
00:16:54,046 --> 00:16:56,446
Thanks to modern
editing techniques...

248
00:16:56,548 --> 00:16:59,915
we can use existing footage
to complete the film without Milhouse.

249
00:17:01,286 --> 00:17:04,119
Watch.

250
00:17:04,223 --> 00:17:08,557
Looks like we're in trouble, Fallout Boy.

251
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:11,254
Jiminy jillickers,
Radioactive Man!

252
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:14,127
We'll have to fight our way out.
Are you ready?

253
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:17,566
Yes.

254
00:17:19,004 --> 00:17:21,029
Seamless, huh?

255
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:23,370
- You're fired.
- And with good cause!

256
00:17:25,677 --> 00:17:27,577
Go!

257
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:30,147
Okay. We can all stop worrying now.

258
00:17:30,249 --> 00:17:31,773
These dogs never fail.

259
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:35,843
But... will they just find Milhouse,
or will they find him and kill him?

260
00:17:35,954 --> 00:17:39,685
Well, they'll-
When they find him, they'll, um-

261
00:17:43,529 --> 00:17:46,794
Excuse me, you didn't answer me.
You just trailed off.

262
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:50,460
Yeah. Yeah, I did kinda... trail off
there, didn't I?

263
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:52,696
<i>I know Milhouse.</i>

264
00:17:52,805 --> 00:17:54,830
I'll just check all his old haunts.

265
00:17:59,111 --> 00:18:01,238
- Have you seen Milhouse?
- No. Now, go away. We're racing...

266
00:18:01,346 --> 00:18:03,314
for the title of
the Champion of the Universe.

267
00:18:06,485 --> 00:18:07,543
All right!

268
00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:16,792
- Yo! Doctor "S." Have you seen Milhouse today?
- No.

269
00:18:16,895 --> 00:18:18,795
- Okay. Thanks.
- Wait.

270
00:18:18,897 --> 00:18:20,660
Did you know
that there's a direct correlation...

271
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:23,064
between the decline of Spirograph
and the rise in gang activity?

272
00:18:23,168 --> 00:18:24,635
- Think about it.
- I will.

273
00:18:24,736 --> 00:18:28,001
No, you won't.

274
00:18:30,576 --> 00:18:32,703
The only place left is the tree house.

275
00:18:36,915 --> 00:18:39,383
- Aha!
- Stay away from me, Bart.

276
00:18:39,485 --> 00:18:41,385
I mean it.
I'm not going back.

277
00:18:41,487 --> 00:18:44,422
- I'm not cut out to be a star.
- But, Milhouse...

278
00:18:44,523 --> 00:18:47,390
being a star is every
patriotic American's dream.

279
00:18:47,493 --> 00:18:49,927
Not mine. It's a sham, Bart.

280
00:18:50,028 --> 00:18:54,260
You get up on that movie screen
pretending to be a hero, but you're not.

281
00:18:54,366 --> 00:18:59,326
The real heroes are out there, toiling
day and night on more important things.

282
00:18:59,438 --> 00:19:01,770
- Television?
- No!

283
00:19:01,874 --> 00:19:04,468
Curing heart disease
and wiping out world hunger.

284
00:19:04,576 --> 00:19:07,306
But, Milhouse,
they haven't cured anything.

285
00:19:07,412 --> 00:19:09,710
Heart disease and world hunger
are still rampant.

286
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:12,875
Those do-gooders are
all a bunch of pitiful losers.

287
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:15,545
Every last one of'em!
Want results?

288
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:17,781
You have to go to
the Schwarzeneggers, the Stallones...

289
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:19,858
and to a lesser extent,
the Van Dammes.

290
00:19:23,862 --> 00:19:25,887
<i>Mickey Rooney.!</i>

291
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:29,161
Hi, Milhouse. The studio
sent me to talk to you...

292
00:19:29,268 --> 00:19:31,896
being a former child star
myself, and...

293
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:36,498
the number-one box office draw
from 1939 through 1940!

294
00:19:36,608 --> 00:19:38,542
Wow! Spanning two decades.

295
00:19:38,644 --> 00:19:42,136
- How'd you find us?
- Uh, they tapped your tree house phone.

296
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:48,681
Milhouse.
Listen, you can't quit this movie.

297
00:19:48,787 --> 00:19:52,279
I've seen your work.
It's good. Very, very good.

298
00:19:52,391 --> 00:19:55,758
- Van Johnson good.
- I know I'm good.

299
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:58,762
- Movie stardom is just so hollow.
- Hollow?

300
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:02,800
The only thing in show business
that's hollow is the music industry.

301
00:20:02,901 --> 00:20:05,096
Come on, Milhouse.
You have to do this.

302
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:07,536
If not for yourself, then
for the movie-going public...

303
00:20:07,639 --> 00:20:12,406
and for the foreign markets that are
more important than ever nowadays.

304
00:20:12,511 --> 00:20:16,447
And finally, for me...

305
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:18,516
the Mickster.

306
00:20:18,617 --> 00:20:21,142
- No!
- All right. I tried.

307
00:20:21,253 --> 00:20:24,950
Fortunately, we have a perfectly good
Fallout Boy right here.

308
00:20:26,325 --> 00:20:28,225
Jiminy jillickers.

309
00:20:28,327 --> 00:20:30,818
Jiminy jillickers.
Jiminy jillickers!

310
00:20:30,929 --> 00:20:35,127
- We're shutting down production.
- Yeah, well, we only have $1,000 left anyway.

311
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:37,566
Ah, there's a $1,000
"leaving town" tax.

312
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:45,108
<i>I hope you're all satisfied.
You bankrupted a bunch of naive movie folks.</i>

313
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:48,941
Folks from a Hollywood
where values are different.

314
00:20:49,047 --> 00:20:50,947
They weren't thinking
about the money.

315
00:20:51,049 --> 00:20:54,849
They just wanted to tell a story.
A story about a radioactive man...

316
00:20:54,953 --> 00:20:58,411
and you slick small-towners
took 'em for all they were worth.

317
00:21:02,194 --> 00:21:04,754
Should we give them
some of their money back?

318
00:21:04,863 --> 00:21:07,696
<i>No.</i>

319
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:11,633
Hurry, Mr. Rooney. We've got a disenchanted
little girl in a Jell-O Pudding commercial.

320
00:21:11,737 --> 00:21:14,035
I could play that.

321
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:17,240
So, Milhouse. It must be
a little tough...

322
00:21:17,342 --> 00:21:19,970
givin' up all that glamour
and comin' back to school, huh?

323
00:21:20,078 --> 00:21:23,047
Quiet! Maybe I can get my citizenship.

324
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:31,487
We know you don't have
any more money left.

325
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:34,753
But that doesn't matter. Just take
whatever you need from our boutiques...

326
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:36,953
until you can get back on your feet.

327
00:21:37,062 --> 00:21:41,328
Thank God we're back in Hollywood,
where people treat each other right.

328
00:22:42,661 --> 00:22:44,629
Shh!

329
00:22:45,629 --> 00:22:55,629

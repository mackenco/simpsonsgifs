<i>The Simpsons</i>

2
00:00:15,415 --> 00:00:17,508
D'oh!

3
00:00:45,011 --> 00:00:47,036
Here's your toast, Maggie.

4
00:00:47,147 --> 00:00:49,479
I melba-fied it myself.

5
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:55,253
<i>Oh, Lisa, honey, I tracked down
those old newspapers for your history project.</i>

6
00:00:55,355 --> 00:00:58,290
Wow, Mom, you didn't have to
go to this much trouble.

7
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:02,157
It was no trouble.
The hoboes at the dump were very helpful.

8
00:01:02,262 --> 00:01:05,129
Except one man, who seemed
to have mental problems.

9
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:07,131
Good morning.

10
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:09,133
It's class photo day.
No Dracula fangs.

11
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:11,897
- But they told us to wear 'em.
- No, they didn't.

12
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,073
<i>Huh?</i>

13
00:01:15,175 --> 00:01:16,938
And don't put signs
on your sister!

14
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:23,445
Now, keep the lettuce
separate until 11:30.

15
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:26,451
That way, the lettuce stays moist
and the bread stays dry.

16
00:01:26,553 --> 00:01:28,316
Huh? Huh?

17
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:31,822
- Mom, you fuss over us way too much.
- Enjoy it now.

18
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:35,122
Because when you're a grown-up
you'll have to take care of yourself!

19
00:01:35,228 --> 00:01:39,358
Marge!
There's a spider near my car keys!

20
00:01:39,466 --> 00:01:42,367
You did the right thing
by telling me.

21
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:44,437
<i>Shoo.!
Get outta here.!</i>

22
00:01:45,505 --> 00:01:47,405
That's better.

23
00:01:47,507 --> 00:01:51,807
Now that we're alone, Papa Bear
has a little honey for his Mama Bear.

24

"Good for a three-hour getaway
at the Mingled Waters Health Spa"?

25
00:01:58,485 --> 00:02:02,251
Mineral bath? Facial massage?
How did you afford these?

26
00:02:02,355 --> 00:02:04,687
Oh, never you mind.

27
00:02:09,028 --> 00:02:12,361
What advantages
does this motorcar have...

28
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:14,365
over, say, a train?

29
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:16,367
Which I could also afford.

30
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:19,632
Well, you'll notice how
the heated gas pedal warms your feet while-

31
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:24,375
Gently massages your buttocks.

32
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:26,707
Well, Count Homer,
shall we discuss the-

33
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:28,576
No, we shan't.
Yoicks!

34
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:34,052
Homie, this is so sweet.
But I can't possibly go now.

35
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:36,054
The sink is full of dirty dishes...

36
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:39,125
the trash needs to be taken out,
the living room is a mess-

37
00:02:39,225 --> 00:02:41,853
- Oh, we'll clean up this afternoon.
- What about Maggie?

38
00:02:41,961 --> 00:02:43,861
I got my dad to look after her.

39
00:02:43,963 --> 00:02:46,864
- Behind ya!
- Don't do that!

40
00:02:46,966 --> 00:02:49,434
Don't do that!

41
00:02:49,536 --> 00:02:53,233
Come on, honey.
You work yourself stupid for this family.

42
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:58,242
If anyone deserves to be wrapped up
in seaweed and buried in mud, it's you.

43
00:02:58,344 --> 00:03:00,244
Mmm.
Well, all right.

44
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:03,144
But I'm taking some of the ironing
with me in the car.

45
00:03:06,786 --> 00:03:08,686
Tighten those braids, missy.

46
00:03:08,788 --> 00:03:10,688
<i>Hoist your flag, Doolie.</i>

47
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:12,690
Nelson, you look adorable.

48
00:03:12,792 --> 00:03:14,692
I feel like punchin' myself!

49
00:03:14,794 --> 00:03:17,558
Bart, stop scratching.
You're messing up your hair.

50
00:03:18,665 --> 00:03:20,565
Lice?

51
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:23,568
How on earth does a boy get head lice
in this day and age?

52
00:03:25,672 --> 00:03:29,005
We bought a wicker basket from Trader Pete's,
and he was passed out inside.

53
00:03:32,011 --> 00:03:35,344
Hey, how come I get lice
and nothing happens to Milhouse?

54
00:03:35,448 --> 00:03:38,281
So cold.

55
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:40,716
So very, very cold.

56
00:03:42,155 --> 00:03:45,613
See ya in hell,
you wingless bloodsuckers.

57
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:53,191
What kind of parents would permit
such a lapse in "scalpal" hygiene?

58
00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:55,563
Well, you'd better check out his sister.

59
00:03:55,668 --> 00:03:58,034
She could be rife
with them "boogs" too.

60
00:03:58,137 --> 00:04:00,469
Keep away!

61
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:02,404
Hey, come on!

62
00:04:02,508 --> 00:04:05,136
Those are prescription shoes!
I need them!

63
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:07,440
You have cooties!

64
00:04:07,547 --> 00:04:10,277
- You have cooties!
- No, I don't!

65
00:04:10,383 --> 00:04:13,284
<i>Lisa Simpson,
report to the principal's office...</i>

66
00:04:13,386 --> 00:04:15,445
<i>for head lice inspection.!</i>

67
00:04:15,555 --> 00:04:17,352
<i>Ooh.! Cooties.! Head lice.!</i>

68
00:04:17,457 --> 00:04:20,358
Oww! My tongue!

69
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:22,428
<i>Heads up.!</i>

70
00:04:25,465 --> 00:04:27,933
Principal Skinner,
I need some "sooes. "

71
00:04:28,034 --> 00:04:30,935
Sweet Georgia Brown!
Something is rotten at the Simpson house!

72
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:42,274
Mmm.

73
00:04:42,382 --> 00:04:46,045
This is so relaxing.

74
00:04:46,152 --> 00:04:48,712
Homie, this was a wonderful idea.

75
00:04:48,821 --> 00:04:51,016
Yeah.

76
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:55,026
If that mafia guy weren't staring at us,
I'd take off my towel.

77
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:57,028
<i>Oh, don't mind-a me.</i>

78
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,598
<i>Look. I do it first.</i>

79
00:05:03,336 --> 00:05:05,327
Whoa.
Would you look at this place?

80
00:05:05,438 --> 00:05:08,339
Sink full of dirty dishes.
Trash not taken out.

81
00:05:08,441 --> 00:05:10,341
Living room a mess.

82
00:05:10,443 --> 00:05:13,469
Stacks of old newspapers
from 20 years ago.

83
00:05:13,579 --> 00:05:17,140
Announcer] Get ready, gamblers,
for the World Series of Dog Racing.

84
00:05:20,687 --> 00:05:22,314
What the- But I-

85
00:05:22,422 --> 00:05:26,552
Hmm. A disheveled and malnourished man
found sleeping in his own filth.

86
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:28,559
<i>Seems confused and dehydrated.</i>

87
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:31,186
- Where's the baby?
- Well, that's her, ain't it?

88
00:05:32,532 --> 00:05:34,693
Kids love that water.

89
00:05:34,801 --> 00:05:36,701
Oh, my lord!

90
00:05:36,803 --> 00:05:39,203
<i>Stupid babies need
the most attention.</i>

91
00:05:39,305 --> 00:05:42,741
<i>All is well. All is well.</i>

92
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:44,742
Turn tape over.

93
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:52,678
All is well. All is well.

94
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:01,592
Children, where are your parents?

95
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:04,527
I don't know.
They should be here.

96
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:06,530
<i>Yes, they should be here.</i>

97
00:06:06,632 --> 00:06:08,532
Tsk-tsk-tsk.

98
00:06:08,634 --> 00:06:11,660
<i>Those parents better have a good excuse.</i>

99
00:06:11,771 --> 00:06:14,672
Oh, I love getting away
from this dump.

100
00:06:14,774 --> 00:06:17,470
It's like I'm on some wonderful drug.

101
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:22,013
- What's going on here?
- Child welfare, ma'am.

102
00:06:22,115 --> 00:06:24,015
Here's a little bedtime reading.

103
00:06:24,117 --> 00:06:26,017
Mmm.

104
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:28,019
"Squalid hellhole"?

105
00:06:28,121 --> 00:06:31,284
"Toilet paper hung
in improper overhand fashion"?

106
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:33,291
"Dogs mating on dining room table"?

107
00:06:35,361 --> 00:06:37,693
<i>What are you doing with my children?</i>

108
00:06:37,797 --> 00:06:40,527
- We're taking them where you can't get them!
- What? No!

109
00:06:40,633 --> 00:06:43,693
No! You can't! I won't let you!

110
00:06:43,803 --> 00:06:47,034
Mrs. Simpson, restrain yourself,
or you'll be arrested.

111
00:06:54,313 --> 00:06:56,213
Now, just relax, kids.

112
00:06:56,315 --> 00:06:58,840
All we're doing is taking you to...

113
00:06:58,951 --> 00:07:01,749
a foster home!

114
00:07:06,826 --> 00:07:08,453
- Yea!
- Hey-diddly-ho!

115
00:07:08,561 --> 00:07:11,121
Welcome to your new home,
neglect-a-rinos!

116
00:07:13,332 --> 00:07:15,527
Kids, meet your new foster family.

117
00:07:15,635 --> 00:07:18,126
We love you!

118
00:07:18,237 --> 00:07:21,365
Uh, please don't hug me.
It sickens me.

119
00:07:21,474 --> 00:07:23,374
I don't judge Homer and Marge.

120
00:07:23,476 --> 00:07:25,376
- That's for a vengeful God to do.
- Mm-hmm.

121
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:28,743
All we wanna do is give you kids a good home
until they get their act together.

122
00:07:28,848 --> 00:07:31,874
You don't understand.
Mom and Dad take good care of us.

123
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:34,920
That was a baby tooth.

124
00:07:36,088 --> 00:07:37,612
It was loose!

125
00:07:37,723 --> 00:07:39,623
Don't you worry, little girl.

126
00:07:39,725 --> 00:07:41,716
We'll get you
some nice county dentures.

127
00:07:48,501 --> 00:07:50,696
"Parents are not to
communicate with children...

128

and must stay at least 100 feet away
at all times. "

129
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:57,606
We leave you the kids for three hours,
and the county takes 'em away?

130
00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:01,043
Oh, bitch, bitch, bitch!

131
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:04,981
I can't believe I put my own pleasure
ahead of my home and family.

132
00:08:05,084 --> 00:08:06,984
That is so like me.

133
00:08:07,086 --> 00:08:08,986
Oh, Marge, don't blame yourself.

134
00:08:09,088 --> 00:08:10,988
<i>I'm the terrible parent.</i>

135
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:14,457
The boy bugs me the hell out of me,
I can't help Lisa with her homework.

136
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,018
The only thing I'm fit to take care of
is a house plant.

137
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:20,291
Lousy house plant!

138
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:24,358
You son of a-
I'll teach you to- D'oh-You-

139
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:36,413
Go with it!

140
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:39,485
Here you go, Todd.
The city edition.

141
00:08:41,287 --> 00:08:43,687
Bart, I don't know
if this should be an extra.

142
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:46,189
Is your source on this reliable?

143
00:08:46,292 --> 00:08:48,192
Oh, I hate this place!

144
00:08:48,294 --> 00:08:52,731
Yeah. It seems like our house, but everything's
got a creepy, Pat Boone-ish quality to it.

145
00:08:52,832 --> 00:08:55,392
Hey, kids!
Nachos, Flanders-style!

146
00:08:55,501 --> 00:08:58,231
That's cucumbers
with cottage cheese!

147
00:09:00,606 --> 00:09:02,437
Oh, Bart.

148
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:04,942
I know you're still
getting adjusted here.

149
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:08,036
<i>Tell you what.
We'll do whatever you wanna do.</i>

150
00:09:08,147 --> 00:09:12,379
<i>- Watch Itchy & Scratchy.!
- Well, I guess a little television won't hurt.</i>

151
00:09:12,485 --> 00:09:16,717
<i>I used to let the boys watch My Three Sons,
but it got 'em all worked up before bedtime.</i>

152
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:22,460
The Itchy & Scratchy Show

153
00:09:38,277 --> 00:09:40,245
Aww!

154
00:09:48,521 --> 00:09:50,921
Why? Why?

155
00:09:53,025 --> 00:09:55,084
My only son.

156
00:10:03,235 --> 00:10:06,500
Daddy, what's the red stuff
coming out of kitty's ears?

157
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:09,769
Uh, uh, that's, uh,
just raspberry jam.

158
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:13,504
Dad, should I poke Rod with a sharp thing
like the mouse did?

159
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:16,639
No, son.
No, sirree, Bob.

160
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:21,878
- Can you see them?
- I can see Lisa.

161
00:10:21,988 --> 00:10:24,081
But it might be a starfish.

162
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:26,351
Yeesh!
I gotta call 'em!

163
00:10:28,561 --> 00:10:30,859
The number you have dialed...

164
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:32,863
can no longer be reached
from this phone...

165
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:34,865
you... negligent... monster.

166
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:36,594
- Ohh!
- That's it!

167
00:10:36,702 --> 00:10:40,502
We're going downtown
to get our kids back right now!

168
00:10:42,274 --> 00:10:44,674
We've always tried
to be good parents.

169
00:10:44,777 --> 00:10:49,180
Please, I'm begging you, one mother
to another. You must have a family.

170
00:10:49,281 --> 00:10:51,374
No, I don't care for children.

171
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:53,384
Now, wait a minute!

172
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:55,886
Okay, I'm not gonna win
Father of the Year.

173
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:59,947
In fact, I'm probably the last guy
in the world who should have kids.

174
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:02,892
<i>Uh- W- W-Well, wait-
Wait. Can I start again?</i>

175
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:05,395
Fathering children
is the best part of my day.

176
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:07,466
I'd do anything
for Bart and Lisa.

177
00:11:07,566 --> 00:11:10,831
- And, uh, Margaret?
- Who? Lady, you got the wrong file.

178
00:11:10,936 --> 00:11:14,064
- It's Maggie.
- Oh, Maggie. I got nothin' against Maggie.

179
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:17,074
I can see you sincerely
want your children back.

180
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:20,077
But you have a lot to learn
about being parents.

181
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:22,079
Before I can return your children...

182
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:25,082
you'll have to complete a course
called family skills.

183
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:28,278
- It teaches parents to listen to their-
- Communication. Gotcha.

184
00:11:28,387 --> 00:11:30,014
- But it's important to-
- Listen! Yes, I know!

185
00:11:30,122 --> 00:11:32,090
- But there's more to it than-
- I have listening skills!

186
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:34,751
- Mr. Simpson, would you please-
- Shut up, Judge!

187
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,885
<i>Peek-a-boo.!
I see you.!</i>

188
00:11:36,996 --> 00:11:40,295
Peek-a-boo! I see you!

189
00:11:42,401 --> 00:11:44,801
I never heard Maggie
laugh like that before.

190
00:11:44,904 --> 00:11:47,805
Well, when was the last time
Dad gave her that kind of attention?

191
00:11:47,907 --> 00:11:50,307
When she swallowed that quarter,
he spent all day with her.

192
00:11:50,409 --> 00:11:53,310
I thought I could ride this thing out,
but everything's just too weird here.

193
00:11:53,412 --> 00:11:56,813
I know! They put honey on our pancakes
instead of maple syrup.

194
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:59,783
<i>And they read Newsweek
instead of nothing!</i>

195
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:03,286
Come on, you gloomy Gusses.
Who's up for a big bowl on nonfat ice milk?

196
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:06,153
- I want wintergreen.
- Unflavored for me.

197
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:11,157
<i>And then I saw my boy
in a burlap sack...</i>

198
00:12:11,263 --> 00:12:14,164
and they told me
he had lice.

199
00:12:14,266 --> 00:12:16,166
Is this story
going somewhere?

200
00:12:16,268 --> 00:12:18,862
Easy there, Flub.
We're all gonna get a chance.

201
00:12:18,971 --> 00:12:20,871
Mrs. Skinner,
why are you here?

202
00:12:20,973 --> 00:12:24,101
The county is threatening
to take my Seymour away.

203
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:28,169
Oh, we had another fight
over the inflatable bath pillow.

204
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:31,181
I kept screeching
and screeching at him, but-

205
00:12:31,283 --> 00:12:35,481
All right, very good. Who knows how the Skinners
could have resolved this problem?

206
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:38,489
Without resorting to violence.

207
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:40,923
Or childish name-calling.

208
00:12:41,026 --> 00:12:43,256
Anybody?
Okay. That's okay.

209
00:12:43,362 --> 00:12:46,923
Because making a happy home
isn't like flipping on a light switch.

210
00:12:47,032 --> 00:12:48,624
Duh, light switch?

211
00:12:48,734 --> 00:12:51,794
There are tricks to it, things you should have
learned a long time ago...

212
00:12:51,904 --> 00:12:55,806
such as, if you leave milk out,
it can go sour.

213
00:12:55,908 --> 00:13:00,368
Put it in the refrigerator,
or, failing that, a cool, wet sack.

214
00:13:01,847 --> 00:13:04,680
And put your garbage
in a garbage can, people.

215
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:07,685
I can't stress that enough.
Don't just throw it out the window.

216
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:10,381
This is so humiliating.

217
00:13:10,489 --> 00:13:13,788
Garbage in garbage can.
Hmm. Makes sense.

218
00:13:13,893 --> 00:13:16,794
Nighty-night,
my sweet little foundling-a-dings.

219
00:13:16,896 --> 00:13:18,796
But it's only 7:00.

220
00:13:18,898 --> 00:13:20,798
Yeah!
The sun is still out!

221
00:13:22,902 --> 00:13:25,336
Ohh!

222
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:31,403
They say your folks
can't pay the rent

223
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:35,241
So we're watching you
by act of government

224
00:13:35,347 --> 00:13:38,714
Well, I don't know
if the allegations are true

225
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:42,413
But you got us
and, baby, we got you

226
00:13:42,521 --> 00:13:44,682
Babe

227
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:47,190
We got you, babe

228
00:13:47,293 --> 00:13:50,194
You know, Maggie hasn't
been a Simpson as long as us.

229
00:13:50,296 --> 00:13:52,787
I think she's beginning
to forget Mom and Dad.

230
00:13:52,898 --> 00:13:57,096
Remember how Mom used to
microwave our underwear on cold days?

231
00:13:57,203 --> 00:14:00,764
Or the way Dad used to call
the radio station with fake traffic tips?

232
00:14:05,244 --> 00:14:08,145
They're ten feet away,
and we can't even talk to them.

233
00:14:08,247 --> 00:14:11,216
I wish I could tell them
how much I miss them.

234
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:22,283
It's so quiet here
without the kids.

235
00:14:22,394 --> 00:14:26,694
What I wouldn't give to hear Lisa
play another one of her jazzy tunes.

236
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:29,529
Saxo-mo-phone

237
00:14:29,635 --> 00:14:32,263
Saxo-mo-phone

238
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:33,770
Ohh.

239
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:37,775
I miss the way Bart would say
something and then say, "Dude. "

240
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:40,778
I wish I knew something
about the baby I could miss now.

241
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,780
- You mean Maggie?
- That's it.

242
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:45,783
I've never been separated
from the kids for so long.

243
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:48,945
<i>I don't know how much more I can take.</i>

244
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:51,318
That's Bart's ring!

245
00:15:02,835 --> 00:15:04,462
"Todd Smells. "

246
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:07,562
- Oh, I already knew that.
- Look at the other side.

247
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:14,546
- Mmm.
- Ohh.

248
00:15:17,449 --> 00:15:19,383
<i>Okay, let's see
if we've learned anything.</i>

249
00:15:19,485 --> 00:15:23,421
I want you two to simulate
a typical household problem. Go.

250
00:15:23,522 --> 00:15:27,185
Uh, Pa, I cut myself
on the screen door again.

251
00:15:27,293 --> 00:15:29,591
Why, you cotton-pickin'-

252
00:15:29,695 --> 00:15:31,959
Hey!

253
00:15:36,869 --> 00:15:40,032
No. I gotta pass this class
for my kids.

254
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:43,438
Son, let's stop
the fussin' and the feudin'.

255
00:15:43,542 --> 00:15:45,339
I love you, Pa!

256
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:47,241
I love you, Cletis!

257
00:15:54,386 --> 00:15:56,377
Well, children,
it's Saturday night, so...

258
00:15:56,488 --> 00:15:59,116
what say we let our hair down
and play Bombardment-

259
00:15:59,224 --> 00:16:02,193
- Yea!
- of Bible Questions!

260
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:04,728
- Yea!
- Which version shall it be?

261
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:07,424
<i>- St. James!
- The Vulgate of St. Jerome.!</i>

262
00:16:08,867 --> 00:16:10,732
<i>- Vulgate it is.
- Ohh.</i>

263
00:16:10,836 --> 00:16:15,603
Okay, for one gold star, what Persian king
exempted the Levites from taxation?

264
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:17,676
- Artaxerxes!
- Righty-o!

265
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:27,478
Tsk-tsk-tsk.
Well?

266
00:16:27,586 --> 00:16:31,044
- I know!
- No, son, we gotta let Bart and Lisa get one.

267
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:33,124
Come on.
This one's easy.

268
00:16:34,226 --> 00:16:35,853
We give up.

269
00:16:35,961 --> 00:16:38,862
Well, guess! Book of Revelations.
Fire-breathing lion's head.

270
00:16:38,964 --> 00:16:41,694
Tail made out of snakes.
Who else is it gonna be?

271
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:44,360
- Jesus?
- Je-

272
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:46,335
Je- Ohh!

273
00:16:46,438 --> 00:16:50,033
Don't you kids know anything?
The serpent of Reheboam?

274
00:16:50,142 --> 00:16:52,201
The well of Zohassadar?

275
00:16:52,311 --> 00:16:55,178
The bridal feast
of Bethchedruharazzeb?

276
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,942
That's the kind of thing
you should start learning at baptism.

277
00:16:58,050 --> 00:16:59,950
Um-

278
00:17:00,052 --> 00:17:02,714
actually, you see-
we were never baptized.

279
00:17:06,091 --> 00:17:08,616
- Oh! Neddie? Neddie!
- Huh?

280
00:17:08,727 --> 00:17:11,696
Neddie!

281
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:15,595
No, that ain't gonna do it.

282
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:17,566
I'm very proud of you people.

283
00:17:17,669 --> 00:17:20,570
You've learned how to care for your children,
how to maintain your homes...

284
00:17:20,672 --> 00:17:22,572
and you've all passed the drug test.

285
00:17:22,674 --> 00:17:25,575
Except for Marge. Marge,
you tested positive for crack and P.C.P.

286
00:17:25,677 --> 00:17:27,201
Oh, my!

287
00:17:27,312 --> 00:17:30,543
Okay, the retest says you're clean.
Sorry about the mistake.

288
00:17:30,649 --> 00:17:33,880
The only thing I'm high on is love-

289
00:17:33,986 --> 00:17:36,580
love for my son and daughters.

290
00:17:36,688 --> 00:17:40,055
Yes, a little L.S.D. is all I need.

291
00:17:40,159 --> 00:17:42,491
All right.
Sounds very good.

292
00:17:46,031 --> 00:17:47,965
Jeepers H. Crackers!

293
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:50,035
I'd better call the reverend.

294
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:55,172
Ned Flanders is on the phone.

295
00:17:55,274 --> 00:17:57,174
Hello, Ned.

296
00:17:57,276 --> 00:17:59,176
Reverend! Emergency!

297
00:17:59,278 --> 00:18:01,178
I-You see, the Simpson kids-
Eedelee-

298
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,111
I- B-Baptism-
Oodelee-

299
00:18:03,215 --> 00:18:05,115
- Th- Doodly-diddly!
- Ned.

300
00:18:05,217 --> 00:18:07,845
Have you thought about
one of the other major religions?

301
00:18:07,953 --> 00:18:09,853
They're all pretty much the same.

302
00:18:11,957 --> 00:18:14,425
Damn Flanders.

303
00:18:15,727 --> 00:18:18,821
Looks like I'm gonna
have to baptize you myself.

304
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:27,195
Kids!
We're good parents now!

305
00:18:27,306 --> 00:18:30,707
- Get your asses out here!
- We missed you so much!

306
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:37,148
<i>He's going to baptize our children?</i>

307
00:18:37,249 --> 00:18:41,515
Oh, no. In the eyes of God,
they'll be Flanderseseseses.

308
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:44,453
Until this, I never thought Homer
and Marge were bad parents.

309
00:18:44,556 --> 00:18:47,957
But now I know you kids need
a less hell-bound family.

310
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:50,324
Just sit back,
and before you know it...

311
00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:52,556
you'll be part of the Flanders flock.

312
00:18:52,664 --> 00:18:56,122
You're gonna be Lisa Flanders.

313
00:18:56,235 --> 00:18:58,294
- You're gonna be Bart Flanders.
- Aaah!

314
00:18:58,403 --> 00:19:01,770
Oh, relax, Bart.
Your sister Maggie isn't scared.

315
00:19:01,874 --> 00:19:03,774
That's because she can't talk.

316
00:19:05,911 --> 00:19:07,879
Daddily-doodily.

317
00:19:11,283 --> 00:19:14,684
- Where are we going? Where are we going?
- Okay, okay. Don't panic.

318
00:19:14,786 --> 00:19:17,687
<i>To find Flanders, I just
have to think like Flanders.</i>

319
00:19:17,789 --> 00:19:19,689
<i>I'm a big, four-eyed lame-o...</i>

320
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:22,589
<i>and I wear the same
stupid sweater every day, and-</i>

321
00:19:22,694 --> 00:19:24,821
The Springfield River!

322
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:27,922
I once was lost

323
00:19:28,033 --> 00:19:31,196
But now am found

324
00:19:31,303 --> 00:19:34,932
Was blind, but now I

325
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:38,237
See-e-e-e

326
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:42,143
Today we write a new page
in the Flanders family Bible.

327
00:19:45,417 --> 00:19:48,352
Who wants to be the first
to enter God's good graces?

328
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:52,046
Easy.
Easy!

329
00:19:54,326 --> 00:19:57,022
Oh, why do you hate my trains?

330
00:20:13,612 --> 00:20:15,944
Ooh- Son of a-
Eee- Ohh- Ooh!

331
00:20:18,483 --> 00:20:21,680
Do you reject Satan
and all his empty promises?

332
00:20:21,787 --> 00:20:29,455
No-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o!

333
00:20:43,275 --> 00:20:45,175
- Mmm!
- Wow, Dad!

334
00:20:45,277 --> 00:20:48,178
You took a baptismal for me.
How do you feel?

335
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:51,181
Oh, Bartholomew,
I feel like St. Augustine of Hippo...

336
00:20:51,283 --> 00:20:53,774
after his conversion
by Ambrose of Milan.

337
00:20:53,885 --> 00:20:56,080
<i>Wait.! Homer.! What did you just say?</i>

338
00:20:56,188 --> 00:20:58,884
- I said, shut your ugly face, Flanders!
- Oh. Fair enough.

339
00:20:58,991 --> 00:21:01,892
Oh, there's my sweet little Maggie.

340
00:21:25,651 --> 00:21:28,279
Oh, Maggie,
you're a Simpson again.

341
00:21:37,195 --> 00:21:40,596
- So, what was it like at the Flanders' house?
- Yeah, give me all the dirt.

342
00:21:40,699 --> 00:21:42,599
Let's see. Dirt.

343
00:21:42,701 --> 00:21:45,192
Dirt. Well, there
wasn't really much dirt.

344
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:48,068
There was a bunch of old paint cans
in their garage though.

345
00:21:50,175 --> 00:21:52,075
Ol' Painty-can Ned!

346
00:21:54,179 --> 00:21:54,279
<i>I always knew
he'd keep his old cans of paint.!</i>

347
00:21:54,314 --> 00:21:57,077
<i>I always knew
he'd keep his old cans of paint.!</i>

348
00:21:57,182 --> 00:21:59,082
<i>Yeah.!</i>

349
00:21:59,184 --> 00:22:01,152
<i>How do you like that?</i>

350
00:22:41,727 --> 00:22:43,695
Shh!

351
00:22:44,695 --> 00:22:54,695

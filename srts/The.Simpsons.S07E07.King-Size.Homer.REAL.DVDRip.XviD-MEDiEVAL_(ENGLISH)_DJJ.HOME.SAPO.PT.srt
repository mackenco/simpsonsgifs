<i>The Simpsons</i>

2
00:00:15,515 --> 00:00:17,506
D'oh!

3
00:00:35,568 --> 00:00:38,435
Come on, Simpson. Open up.
We know you're in there.

4
00:00:42,942 --> 00:00:46,105
<i>Mmm. That one.</i>

5
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:48,578
Someone's in here.

6
00:00:48,681 --> 00:00:50,581
<i>No.!</i>

7
00:00:50,683 --> 00:00:53,846
No! No! Oh!

8
00:00:53,953 --> 00:00:56,683
<i>- Oh, for the love of-
- Boy.</i>

9
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:59,953
I've never seen a man so desperate
to get out of five minutes of calisthenics.

10
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,085
One, two, three, four.

11
00:01:02,195 --> 00:01:05,892
<i>Up, down, three, four.</i>

12
00:01:05,999 --> 00:01:08,229
This new exercise program is great.

13
00:01:08,334 --> 00:01:10,894
Yeah. Every muscle in my body's
gettin' a workout.

14
00:01:11,004 --> 00:01:13,131
Especially my big fat mouth.

15
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:15,833
Yeah, especially your big fat-
Oh, wait.

16
00:01:15,942 --> 00:01:18,274
Raise your right hock. Aerate.

17
00:01:18,378 --> 00:01:20,676
Raise your left hock.
Aerate.

18
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:23,578
I want to see more Teddy Roosevelts
and less Franklin Roosevelts.

19
00:01:25,518 --> 00:01:27,543
Two!

20
00:01:27,654 --> 00:01:29,554
Uh, actually, Homer,
that's just one.

21
00:01:29,656 --> 00:01:32,921
See, each pushup includes both
an up part and a down part.

22
00:01:33,026 --> 00:01:34,152
D'oh!

23
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:37,821
Hey, where's Charlie?
How'd he get outta this?

24
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:39,831
Aw, he's at home on disability.

25
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:41,059
He got injured on the job,
and they sent him home with pay.

26
00:01:41,201 --> 00:01:42,302
It's like a lottery
that rewards stupidity.

27
00:01:42,337 --> 00:01:42,961
It's like a lottery
that rewards stupidity.

28
00:01:49,008 --> 00:01:50,236
Stupidity, eh?

29
00:01:50,343 --> 00:01:51,241
Must hurt self.

30
00:01:51,344 --> 00:01:52,811
Must hurt self.

31
00:01:57,183 --> 00:01:59,083
D'oh!

32
00:02:00,887 --> 00:02:03,082
Hmm. Probably better
that didn't hit me.

33
00:02:14,534 --> 00:02:17,025
- Yes?
- Hello.

34
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:18,866
May I help you?

35
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:20,667
Uh...

36
00:02:20,773 --> 00:02:23,037
could you give me a little push
in the opposite direction?

37
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:25,008
Okay.

38
00:02:26,212 --> 00:02:28,112
Thank you.

39
00:02:28,214 --> 00:02:30,648
Carpal tunnel syndrome? No.

40
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,650
Lumber lung? No.

41
00:02:32,752 --> 00:02:36,188
Juggler's despair? No.
Achy-breaky pelvis? No.

42
00:02:36,289 --> 00:02:38,553
Oh! I'm never gonna be disabled.

43
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:40,922
I'm sick of being so healthy.

44
00:02:41,027 --> 00:02:42,927
Hey, wait.

45
00:02:43,029 --> 00:02:45,862
"Hyperobesity.

46
00:02:45,965 --> 00:02:48,126
"If you weigh more
than 300 pounds...

47
00:02:48,234 --> 00:02:50,794
you qualify as disabled. "

48
00:02:58,211 --> 00:03:01,874
- You can do it, old boy.
- Yes, I can!

49
00:03:04,717 --> 00:03:06,776
Yes, yes. That's the spirit.

50
00:03:09,122 --> 00:03:11,886
If you gain 61 pounds,
they'll let you work at home?

51
00:03:11,991 --> 00:03:16,121
Yuh-huh. That's the deal.
No more exercise program. No more traffic.

52
00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:18,754
No more blood drives
or charity walks.

53
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:20,992
Dad, I know we don't
do a lot together...

54
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:24,900
but helping you gain 61 pounds
is something I want to be a part of.

55
00:03:25,004 --> 00:03:26,369
Dad!

56
00:03:26,472 --> 00:03:28,565
I must protest.
You're abusing a program...

57
00:03:28,675 --> 00:03:30,575
intended to help the unfortunate.

58
00:03:30,677 --> 00:03:33,441
I'm not saying
it isn't sleazy, honey.

59
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:35,446
But try to see it my way.

60
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:38,847
All my life, I've been an obese man
trapped inside a fat man's body.

61
00:03:38,952 --> 00:03:42,388
- Have you told Mom about this?
- No. It would only worry her.

62
00:03:42,488 --> 00:03:44,479
If you want to add
to her worries, go ahead.

63
00:03:44,591 --> 00:03:47,253
I guess I'm just a little more grateful
for all she's done for us.

64
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,123
- Dad!
- Yes, sweetheart?

65
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:52,460
Obesity is really unhealthy.
Any doctor will tell you that.

66
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:56,228
Oh, yeah? Well, we'll just see about that,
little Miss Smart Guy.

67
00:03:56,336 --> 00:03:58,804
My God! That's monstrous.

68
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:01,703
I've never heard of anything
so negligen-

69
00:04:01,808 --> 00:04:04,436
I'll have no part of it.

70
00:04:04,544 --> 00:04:07,638
- Can you recommend a doctor who will?
- Yes.

71
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:09,476
Hi, everybody!

72
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:11,345
Hi, Dr. Nick!

73
00:04:11,451 --> 00:04:13,646
Now, there are many
options available...

74
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:17,849
for dangerously underweight
individuals like yourself.

75
00:04:17,957 --> 00:04:21,791
I recommend a slow,
steady gorging process...

76
00:04:21,894 --> 00:04:24,624
combined with assal horizontology.

77
00:04:24,731 --> 00:04:26,426
Of course.

78
00:04:26,532 --> 00:04:29,592
You'll want to focus
on the neglected food groups...

79
00:04:29,702 --> 00:04:32,603
<i>such as the whipped group,
the congealed group...</i>

80
00:04:32,705 --> 00:04:34,605
<i>and the chocotastic.</i>

81
00:04:34,707 --> 00:04:37,232
What can I do to speed
the whole thing up, Doctor?

82
00:04:37,343 --> 00:04:41,746
Ah, be creative. Instead of making
sandwiches with bread, use Pop-Tarts.

83
00:04:41,848 --> 00:04:44,442
Instead of chewing gum, chew bacon.

84
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:46,711
You could brush your teeth
with milk shakes.

85
00:04:46,819 --> 00:04:51,051
Hey, did you go to Hollywood Upstairs
Medical College too?

86
00:04:51,157 --> 00:04:54,558
And remember, if you're
not sure about something...

87
00:04:54,661 --> 00:04:56,925
rub it against a piece of paper.

88
00:04:57,030 --> 00:05:00,989
If the paper turns clear,
it's your window to weight gain.

89
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:03,068
Bye-bye, everybody!

90
00:05:03,169 --> 00:05:05,330
Oh, it's a dream come true, boy.

91
00:05:05,438 --> 00:05:07,397
I can- Nay, I must eat everything
I've always wanted.

92
00:05:12,178 --> 00:05:13,907
Now, come on.
Every second I'm out of bed...

93
00:05:14,013 --> 00:05:15,913
I'm burning precious calories.

94
00:05:16,015 --> 00:05:18,779
Now get grabbin'.

95
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:33,231
Eat around the banana, Dad.
It's just empty vitamins.

96
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:48,981
Lucky for you,
this stuff doesn't work.

97
00:05:54,987 --> 00:05:57,478
I don't know.
Fish sandwich.

98
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:59,490
Are you sure?

99
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:09,165
Oh! 225?
That means I lost weight!

100
00:06:09,268 --> 00:06:12,931
Homer. You're, uh, on the towel rack.

101
00:06:15,608 --> 00:06:19,908
Whoo-hoo! Four more pounds,
and my dream comes true.

102
00:06:20,012 --> 00:06:22,446
Working at home.

103
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:30,781
Here's your lemonade,
and here's your beer.

104
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:34,621
Oh! You're such a vigorous
young go-getter.

105
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:36,752
When's your next coffee break?

106
00:06:36,863 --> 00:06:39,161
Anytime I want.

107
00:06:48,007 --> 00:06:50,475
- Oh.
- Hey, Flanders.

108
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:52,635
- Bad day at the rat races?
- Yeah.

109
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:56,146
A crazy guy shot a bunch of people,
and a subway ran over my hat.

110
00:06:59,986 --> 00:07:02,045
Hey, Lise.
Come look at this.

111
00:07:02,155 --> 00:07:03,622
Neat.

112
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:09,960
Homer! Whoa!

113
00:07:10,062 --> 00:07:12,496
- Hello, honey.
- Hi.

114
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:16,261
Um, there's something
I've been meaning to ask you.

115
00:07:16,369 --> 00:07:18,735
Did you put on
a little weight this week?

116
00:07:18,838 --> 00:07:21,500
I was going to surprise you,
but what the heck.

117
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:26,271
Honey, I'm purposely gaining 61 pounds
to get on disability.

118
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:29,143
Have you lost your mind?

119
00:07:29,248 --> 00:07:32,240
Have you thought about your health
or your appearance?

120
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:34,581
Oh. So that's it, isn't it, Marge?

121
00:07:34,687 --> 00:07:36,985
Looks. I didn't know
you were so shallow.

122
00:07:37,089 --> 00:07:40,115
Oh, please! I would love you
if you weighed 1,000 pounds. But-

123
00:07:40,226 --> 00:07:41,921
Beautiful. Good night.

124
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:47,789
<i>Oh.! I got 15 minutes to gain a pound,
or I gotta face another day at work.</i>

125
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,800
Bad news, Dad.
We're out of food.

126
00:07:49,902 --> 00:07:51,802
We're even out of
the basic elements of food.

127
00:07:51,904 --> 00:07:54,372
You ate all the tarragon,
and you drank all the soy sauce.

128
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:57,238
I need a miracle.

129
00:08:03,382 --> 00:08:06,909
Aw, honey.
It looks just like a real doughnut.

130
00:08:07,019 --> 00:08:09,954
Dad, it says "Non-Toxic. "

131
00:08:10,056 --> 00:08:12,650
Well, that's a plus.

132
00:08:16,562 --> 00:08:19,463
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
I did it!

133
00:08:19,565 --> 00:08:21,863
Uh, Dad. Towel rack.

134
00:08:25,571 --> 00:08:28,096
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
Hee-hee! Ho-ho! Oh, my.

135
00:08:36,048 --> 00:08:37,345
I'm pleased to dedicate
this remote work terminal.

136
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:40,112
It will allow our safety inspector here
to perform his duties from home.

137
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:43,347
And so, excelsior to you, Mr. -

138
00:08:43,456 --> 00:08:45,424
What's the name
of this gastropod?

139
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:48,016
Simpson, sir. One of
your chair-moisteners from Sector 7G.

140
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:50,186
Yes! Simpson!

141
00:08:52,398 --> 00:08:55,026
Thank you for your pity.

142
00:08:55,134 --> 00:08:58,365
Mom, are you ever planning
to step in and put a stop to this?

143
00:08:58,471 --> 00:09:01,167
Normally, your father's
crackpot schemes fizzle out...

144
00:09:01,274 --> 00:09:03,538
as soon as he finds
something good on TV.

145
00:09:03,643 --> 00:09:05,634
But this season-

146
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:20,691
I'm looking for something
loose and billowy...

147
00:09:20,793 --> 00:09:22,693
something comfortable
for my first day of work.

148
00:09:22,795 --> 00:09:25,593
Work, huh? Let me guess.
Computer programmer?

149
00:09:25,698 --> 00:09:29,828
- Computer magazine columnist. Something with computers.
- Well, I use a computer.

150
00:09:29,936 --> 00:09:32,336
What's the connection? Must be
the nonstop sitting and snacking.

151
00:09:32,438 --> 00:09:35,965
Well, sir. Many of our clients
find pants confining...

152
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:39,636
so we offer a range of alternatives
for the ample gentleman.

153
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:42,441
Ponchos, muumuus,
capes, jumpsuits...

154
00:09:42,548 --> 00:09:46,314
<i>unisheets, muslin body rolls,
academic andjudicial robes.</i>

155
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:49,411
I don't wanna look like a weirdo.
I'll just go with a muumuu.

156
00:09:57,797 --> 00:10:00,129
<i>Arnie Pie in the Sky with the morning commute.</i>

157
00:10:00,232 --> 00:10:02,223
Traffic this morning
is as bad as it gets.

158
00:10:02,335 --> 00:10:04,235
Due to a fire
at the army testing lab...

159
00:10:04,337 --> 00:10:07,704
a bunch of escaped, infected monkeys
are roaming the expressway.

160
00:10:07,807 --> 00:10:10,503
Despite the sweltering heat,
don't unroll your windows...

161
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:13,807
'cause those monkeys
seem confused and irritable.

162
00:10:13,913 --> 00:10:17,644
Hee-hee-hee! I pity
those poor suckers on the freeway.

163
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:20,776
Gas, brake, honk.
Gas, brake, honk.

164
00:10:20,886 --> 00:10:23,753
Honk, honk, punch.
Gas, gas, gas.

165
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,619
8:58.

166
00:10:29,729 --> 00:10:33,062
First time I've ever
been early for work-

167
00:10:33,165 --> 00:10:35,326
except for all those
daylight savings days.

168
00:10:35,434 --> 00:10:36,901
Lousy farmers.

169
00:10:37,003 --> 00:10:41,099
"To start, press any key. "
Where's the "Any" key?

170
00:10:41,207 --> 00:10:45,473
I see "Esk," "Catarol,"
and "Pig Up. "

171
00:10:45,578 --> 00:10:48,103
There doesn't seem to be
any "Any" key.

172
00:10:48,214 --> 00:10:51,115
Whew! All this computer hacking
is making me thirsty.

173
00:10:51,217 --> 00:10:53,117
I think I'll order a Tab.

174
00:10:53,219 --> 00:10:56,882
Oop. No time for that now.
The computer's starting.

175
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:59,617
"Check core temperature?

176
00:10:59,725 --> 00:11:02,785
Yes/No. " Yes.

177
00:11:02,895 --> 00:11:06,490
<i>"Core temperature normal. "
Hmm. Not too shabby.</i>

178
00:11:06,599 --> 00:11:11,366
"Vent radioactive gas?"
N-O.

179
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:14,439
<i>"Venting prevents explo-si-on. "</i>

180
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:18,374
Ooh, this is hard. Where's my Tab?

181
00:11:18,477 --> 00:11:21,071
Okay, then. Yes.
Vent the stupid gas.

182
00:11:28,988 --> 00:11:31,286
Aw, no! The corn!

183
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:33,790
Paul Newman's gonna have
my legs broke.

184
00:11:33,893 --> 00:11:36,418
Bart and Lisa have to go to school...

185
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:38,429
while I get to stay home.

186
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:40,226
Nyah-nyah-nyah,
nyah-nyah-nyah.

187
00:11:40,332 --> 00:11:42,425
- I like school.
- Why don't you live in it then?

188
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:45,561
- I would if I could.
- Not me, sister.

189
00:11:45,671 --> 00:11:49,198
When I grow up, I wanna be a lardo
on workmen's comp...

190
00:11:49,308 --> 00:11:51,333
just like Dad.

191
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:57,315
I wash myself with a rag on a stick.

192
00:12:02,688 --> 00:12:05,213
- Whoo-ooh-ooh.
- Euw!

193
00:12:05,324 --> 00:12:08,088
Mom! This whole thing
is really creepy.

194
00:12:08,194 --> 00:12:09,821
Are you sure
you won't talk to Dad?

195
00:12:09,929 --> 00:12:13,092
I'd like to, honey,
but I'm not sure how.

196
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:15,497
Your father can be
surprisingly sensitive.

197
00:12:15,601 --> 00:12:17,728
Remember when I giggled
at his Sherlock Holmes hat?

198
00:12:17,837 --> 00:12:20,806
He sulked for a week
and then closed his detective agency.

199
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:22,806
Maybe you'll have
to hurt his feelings.

200
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:25,934
The longer he lives like this,
the harder it'll be to go back.

201
00:12:26,045 --> 00:12:28,513
You're right.

202
00:12:28,614 --> 00:12:32,015
Hmm. Maybe if I use
my least-nagging tone of voice-

203
00:12:32,118 --> 00:12:34,018
Homer. Mmm.

204
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,246
Homer!

205
00:12:35,354 --> 00:12:36,480
Homer?

206
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:38,557
That's it. That's the one.
All right. Send him on in.

207
00:12:39,992 --> 00:12:42,085
- Dad?
- Yes, honey?

208
00:12:42,194 --> 00:12:45,755
- Um, Mom just baked a cake.
- Ooh!

209
00:12:45,865 --> 00:12:47,526
Hmm?

210
00:12:47,633 --> 00:12:50,534
Homer, we need to have
a serious talk.

211
00:12:50,636 --> 00:12:52,627
You dragged me all the way
from work for that?

212
00:12:52,738 --> 00:12:56,071
Let's quietly and calmly
discuss the pros and cons...

213
00:12:56,175 --> 00:12:58,700
of your controversial plan,
shall we?

214
00:12:58,811 --> 00:13:01,211
- I-
- Con: You're endangering your health.

215
00:13:01,313 --> 00:13:04,077
Pro: I'm drought and famine resistant.

216
00:13:04,183 --> 00:13:06,549
Con: You're setting a bad example
for the children.

217
00:13:06,652 --> 00:13:08,483
Pro: I, uh, don't have to go to work.

218
00:13:08,587 --> 00:13:12,148
Con: You're running the air conditioner
nonstop. It's freezing in here.

219
00:13:12,258 --> 00:13:16,490
Pro: Uh- Uh, I love you.

220
00:13:16,595 --> 00:13:22,124
Con: I'm finding myself
less attracted to you physically.

221
00:13:24,403 --> 00:13:27,964
- Marge, this is everything I've
ever dreamed of- right here.

222
00:13:28,073 --> 00:13:30,371
And nobody's gonna
take it away from me.

223
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:34,071
You never had faith in me before,
but let me tell you-

224
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:37,149
the slim, lazy Homer you knew is dead.

225
00:13:37,249 --> 00:13:40,309
Now I'm a big, fat dynamo!

226
00:13:40,419 --> 00:13:42,353
And where's that cake?

227
00:13:42,454 --> 00:13:44,718
- There's no cake.
- Oh.

228
00:13:46,225 --> 00:13:48,557
"Vent radioactive gas?"

229
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:50,128
Y-E-S.

230
00:13:50,229 --> 00:13:52,163
"Sound alertness horn?"

231
00:13:52,264 --> 00:13:54,357
Y-E-S.

00:13:54,466 --> 00:13:56,331
<i>"Decalcify calcium ducts?"</i>

233
00:13:56,435 --> 00:13:58,835
Well, give me a "Y."

234
00:13:58,938 --> 00:14:01,065
Give me a- Hey.

235
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:03,300
All I have to type is "Y."

236
00:14:03,409 --> 00:14:06,378
Hey, Miss Doesn't Find Me
Attractive Sexually Anymore.

237
00:14:06,478 --> 00:14:10,744
- I just tripled my productivity.
- Good. Good for you.

238
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,750
"Y." "Y."

239
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:15,013
So many letters to choose from.

240
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:19,523
I'll pick "Y." "Y." "Y."

241
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:21,855
What the heck are you
doin' over there?

242
00:14:21,961 --> 00:14:25,124
There! You found the floor.

243
00:14:25,231 --> 00:14:27,495
"Y." "Y." "Y." "Y."

244
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,727
"Y." "Y."

245
00:14:29,835 --> 00:14:32,167
I'm going out.
I run errands during the day.

246
00:14:32,271 --> 00:14:34,171
Could you pick me up
a lemonade and a beer?

247

<i>The mail! The mail is here!</i>

Ooh! "An urgent plea

<i>"Lisa Simpson, can you afford to miss

251
00:14:57,363 --> 00:15:00,491
Free sample of fabric softener?
Whoo-hoo!

252
00:15:06,338 --> 00:15:10,399
<i>Mmm! I can feel
three kinds of softness.</i>

253
00:15:10,509 --> 00:15:12,443
<i>Dad, what are you doing down there?</i>

254
00:15:12,544 --> 00:15:14,910

257
00:15:21,487 --> 00:15:24,479
I inherit the entire plantation.

I'll see to it
you don't get apricot one.

Uh, what's your dad's job again?

260
00:15:36,702 --> 00:15:39,136
He's a nuclear-safety technician.

261
00:15:39,238 --> 00:15:41,536
What's he doin' with that broom?

262

Uh, what isn't he doing?

00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:47,475
I heard that guy's ass

Hey! Leave my dad alone.

265
00:15:51,483 --> 00:15:54,077
Just because he's overweight
doesn't mean he's bad.

266

He's a sweet man,

Hey, Homer.

You promised Mom
you wouldn't wear your dress outside.

272
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:13,203
Nuts to that.
I'm goin' to the movies.

273
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:16,297
- Shouldn't you be working?
- I got someone to cover for me.

274
00:16:22,681 --> 00:16:26,845
<i>- One for Honk, please.
- Oh, gee. Uh, just a minute.</i>

<i>I have to check with the manager.</i>

That overweight guy
wants to see the movie.

277
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:38,422
I'm terribly sorry, sir. I'm afraid our facilities
are not equipped to meet your needs.

278
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:42,261
- What are you talking about?
- What I'm saying, sir, is that a man of your carriage...

279
00:16:42,368 --> 00:16:44,461
couldn't possibly fit in our seats.

280
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:47,869
- I could sit in the aisle.
- I'm afraid that would violate the fire code.

281
00:16:47,973 --> 00:16:50,567
<i>Hey, fatty.! I got a movie for ya.</i>

<i>A Fridge Too Far.</i>

I'd be happy to treat you
to a garbage bag full of popcorn.

Oh! This may surprise you,
but you can't buy me off with food.

288
00:17:09,261 --> 00:17:12,321
I'm sick of all your stereotypes
and cheap jokes.

289
00:17:12,431 --> 00:17:14,331
The overweight individuals
in this country...

290
00:17:14,433 --> 00:17:17,834
are just as smart and talented
and hardworking as everybody else.

291
00:17:17,936 --> 00:17:19,665
And they're gonna make
their voices heard.

292
00:17:19,772 --> 00:17:23,208
All they need is a leader!

293
00:17:23,308 --> 00:17:25,208
I'll work harder than ever before...

294
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:27,278
and show the world overweight people
aren't undisciplined...

295
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:30,007
lazy and irresponsible.

296
00:17:30,115 --> 00:17:32,174
What happened to my bird?

297
00:17:34,353 --> 00:17:37,322
Oh! Marge?

298
00:17:37,423 --> 00:17:40,392
Lisa? Flanders?

299

- Who cares? It's Homer's problem.

302
00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:01,138
Wait. I know. Vent gas.

00:18:06,185 --> 00:18:08,085
Aw! Stupid bird!

306
00:18:08,187 --> 00:18:10,018
I never should have
put you in charge!

307
00:18:10,122 --> 00:18:12,750
Why, you-

308
00:18:12,858 --> 00:18:15,224
Oh, who am I kidding?
It's all my fault.

309
00:18:15,327 --> 00:18:18,228
I gotta call the plant and warn 'em.

310
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:24,602
- The fingers you
have used to dial are too fat.

311
00:18:24,703 --> 00:18:26,671
To obtain a special dialing wand...

312
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:29,866
please mash the keypad with your palm now.

313
00:18:29,975 --> 00:18:32,808
I'm gonna have
to shut it down myself!

314
00:18:32,911 --> 00:18:34,635
<i>Fat, don't fail me now.! D'oh.!</i>

315
00:18:44,656 --> 00:18:48,251
You gotta slow your car down and let me in
because I'm a big fat guy and I can't go anywhere.

316
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:51,124
Because there's gonna be some poison gas.
There's gonna be really poison gas.

317
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:54,199
Everybody's gonna be dead,
especially me! D'oh!

318
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:56,859
The ice-cream man.

319
00:18:58,871 --> 00:19:01,362
You gotta let me in your car
and drive me-

320
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:03,839
Take anything you want, man!
Take it all!

321
00:19:05,744 --> 00:19:07,769
Push out the jive.

322
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,711
Bring in the love.

323
00:19:13,352 --> 00:19:17,584
I heard your dad went into a restaurant
and ate everything in the restaurant...

324
00:19:17,689 --> 00:19:19,623
and they had to close
the restaurant.

325
00:19:19,725 --> 00:19:21,659
My dad may have
gained a little weight...

326
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:25,059
but he's not some kind
of food-crazed maniac.

327
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:27,257
Ah! Oh! That's raspberry.

328
00:19:27,366 --> 00:19:29,061
Oh.

329
00:19:32,204 --> 00:19:34,866
Ice cream! Ice cream!

330
00:19:34,973 --> 00:19:38,101
Workers, please. There'll be time
for the frozen-pudding wagon later.

331
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:41,145
You still owe me
10 more Iroquois twists.

332
00:19:41,246 --> 00:19:43,544
- Ten, ha-ya-yah.
- Uh!

333
00:19:43,649 --> 00:19:46,311
- And nine, ha-ya-yah.
- Uh!

334
00:19:49,054 --> 00:19:51,454
Get away, damn it!
Run for your lives!

335
00:19:51,557 --> 00:19:54,390
- I'll take a rocket bomb!
- What can I get for 30 cents?

336
00:19:54,493 --> 00:19:57,860
Let go!
I gotta get to the tank!

337
00:20:02,267 --> 00:20:04,462
Heck, I can't decide
without the pictures.

338
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:06,367
Six, ha-ya-yah.

339
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:10,398
Oh!

340
00:20:11,577 --> 00:20:13,442
Four, ha-ya-yah.

341
00:20:19,985 --> 00:20:22,249
Three, ha-ya-yah.

342
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:30,926
Two, ha-ya-yah.

343
00:20:35,934 --> 00:20:39,165
Stupid switch!
I wish I had my reaching broom.

344
00:20:39,271 --> 00:20:41,205
One, ha-ya-yah.

345
00:20:44,109 --> 00:20:46,805
Wait a minute.
There's probably a-

346
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:56,012
Homer, your bravery
and quick thinking...

347
00:20:56,121 --> 00:20:58,248
have turned a potential Chernobyl...

348
00:20:58,357 --> 00:21:00,325
into a mere Three Mile Island.

349
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:02,325
Bravo.

350
00:21:04,162 --> 00:21:06,494
I think it's ironic
that Dad saved the day...

351
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:09,158
while a slimmer man
would have fallen to his death.

352
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:11,566
And I think it's ironic that,
for once, Dad's butt...

353
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:13,968
- prevented the release of toxic gas-
- Bart!

354
00:21:14,072 --> 00:21:17,974
We'll have you out of there as soon as
our tech boys get you decontaminated.

355
00:21:18,076 --> 00:21:20,874
Thank you, Mr. Burns.

356
00:21:20,979 --> 00:21:23,948
It was pretty scary up there, but-

357
00:21:24,049 --> 00:21:27,212
For a while, I feared for my life.

358
00:21:30,088 --> 00:21:33,285
Now, Homer, if there's anything else
I can do for you...

359
00:21:33,392 --> 00:21:36,122
please don't hesitate to ask.

360
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:43,692
Mr. Burns,
can you make me thin again?

361
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:45,360
I guarantee it.

362
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:48,132
One.

363
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,266
One. One!

364
00:21:51,376 --> 00:21:53,867
Bah! I'll just pay
for the blasted liposuction.

365
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:55,446
Whoo-hoo!

366
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:43,786
Shh!

367
00:22:44,786 --> 00:22:54,786

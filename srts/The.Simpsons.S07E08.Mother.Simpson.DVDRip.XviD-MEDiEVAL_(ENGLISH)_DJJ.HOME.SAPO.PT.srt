<i>The Simpsons</i>

2
00:00:10,477 --> 00:00:12,468
D'oh!

3
00:00:29,562 --> 00:00:33,760
Here's your caption, boys. "Local Hero
Shuns Spotlight and Pitches In. "

4
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:36,028
What an angle!

5
00:00:37,637 --> 00:00:41,198
I can't believe I'm spending
my Saturday picking up garbage.

6
00:00:41,307 --> 00:00:44,299
I mean, half these bottles ain't even mine.

7
00:00:44,411 --> 00:00:47,574
<i>Let's have less conversation
and more sanitation.</i>

8
00:00:52,652 --> 00:00:54,847
Hey, where's Homer?
How'd he get out of this?

9
00:00:54,954 --> 00:00:57,582
<i>Hey, everybody.! Up here.!</i>

10
00:00:58,992 --> 00:01:00,789
Simpson, stop frolicking
and get to work.

11
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:02,794
Right away, Mr. Smithers.

12
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:05,296
I'll just walk across
these slippery rock-

13
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,129
Oh, no! He's going
over the falls!

14
00:01:12,138 --> 00:01:14,231
<i>Oh, good.
He snagged that tree branch.</i>

15
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,308
Oh, no!
The branch broke off.

16
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:19,977
<i>Oh, good. He can grab
onto them pointy rocks.</i>

17
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:24,244
Oh, no. Them rocks broke his arms and legs!

18
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:27,717
<i>Oh, good. Those helpful beavers
are swimming out to save him.</i>

19
00:01:27,821 --> 00:01:31,416
<i>Oh, no. They're biting him
and stealing his pants.</i>

20
00:01:32,859 --> 00:01:35,327
<i>Good lord.! He'll be
sucked into the turbine.</i>

21
00:01:41,201 --> 00:01:43,567
Smithers,
who was that corpse?

22
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:45,763
Homer Simpson, sir.

23
00:01:45,872 --> 00:01:50,309
One of the finest, bravest men
ever to grace Sector 7G.

24
00:01:51,511 --> 00:01:53,411
I'll cross him off the list.

25
00:01:55,515 --> 00:01:57,881
That dummy
worked like a charm, Dad.

26
00:01:57,984 --> 00:01:59,884
Best 600 bucks
I ever spent.

27
00:01:59,986 --> 00:02:02,511
Come on, boy.
We've earned this Saturday.

28
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:04,817
Now let's make
the most of it!

29
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:12,727
Sixty-one.
Sixty-two. Sixty-three.

30
00:02:16,503 --> 00:02:20,530
<i>Marge, we can't tell you how sorry we are.</i>

31
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,007
You have our deepest
condol-diddly-olences.

32
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:26,908
I'm sorry. I-I'm just nervous.
I didn't mean any disrespect.

33
00:02:27,013 --> 00:02:28,878
- What are you talking about?
- You know. Uh-

34
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:31,482
Homer's passing.

35
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:35,012
Away.

36
00:02:35,121 --> 00:02:36,952
- Into death.
- What?

37
00:02:39,025 --> 00:02:42,517
That's ridiculous. Homer's not dead.
He's right out back in the hammock.

38
00:02:46,266 --> 00:02:48,757
Oh, Marge.
Of course Homer's alive.

39
00:02:48,868 --> 00:02:51,098
He's alive
in all our hearts.

40
00:02:51,204 --> 00:02:53,502
Yes, Marge.
I can see him.

41
00:02:53,606 --> 00:02:55,870
Hi, everybody!

42
00:02:55,975 --> 00:02:58,603
Marge, I'm gonna give you the card
of our juvenile counselor.

43
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:03,748
<i>A tombstone?</i>

44
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:06,216
It came with the burial plot.
But that's not important.

45
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,651
The important thing
is Homer is dead.

46
00:03:08,755 --> 00:03:10,985
We've been saving for this
since your wedding day.

47
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:14,025
Get out of here,
you ghouls!

48
00:03:14,127 --> 00:03:16,288
<i>Ayayayaya.!</i>

49
00:03:16,396 --> 00:03:17,658
Hmm?

50
00:03:19,065 --> 00:03:22,364
Uh, excuse me. Sir?
I think there's been a mistake.

51
00:03:22,468 --> 00:03:24,368
Oh, no.
No mistake.

52
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:27,371
Your electricity's in the name
of HomerJ. Simpson, deceased.

53
00:03:27,473 --> 00:03:29,941
The juice stays off till you get
a job or a generator.

54
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:31,943
Oh, and, uh,
my deepest sympathies.

55
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:34,741
- Homer.
- That's my name.

56
00:03:34,847 --> 00:03:38,783
When I asked you if that dummy was to fake
your own death, you told me no.

57
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:41,979
You go downtown first thing in the morning
and straighten this out.

58
00:03:42,088 --> 00:03:46,081
Mom! Dad! Bart ran into
a door frame and bit his tongue!

59
00:03:46,192 --> 00:03:48,092
What the hell is going on here?

60
00:03:49,529 --> 00:03:52,692
Listen here!
My name is HomerJ. Simpson!

61
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:54,699
You guys think I'm dead,
but I'm not.

62
00:03:54,801 --> 00:03:56,769
I want you to straighten
this out without a lot...

63
00:03:56,869 --> 00:03:59,838
- of your bureaucratic red tape and mumbo jumbo!
- Okay, Mr. Simpson.

64
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:03,238
I'll just make the change here.
And you're all set.

65
00:04:03,343 --> 00:04:05,811
I don't like your attitude,
you watercooler dictator.

66
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:09,473
What do you have in that secret government
file anyway? I have a right to read it.

67
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:11,482
You sure do.

68
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:14,451
"Wife: Marjorie.
Children: Bartholomew, Lisa"-

69
00:04:14,554 --> 00:04:17,990
Aha! See?
This thing is all screwed up!

70
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:20,059
Who the heck
is Margaret Simpson?

71
00:04:20,159 --> 00:04:23,925
- Uh, your youngest daughter.
- "Uh, your youngest daughter. "

72
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:27,056
Well, how about this?
This thing says my mother's still alive!

73
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:30,761
She died when I was a kid!
See that stone angel up there?

74
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:32,770
That's my mother's grave!

75
00:04:32,872 --> 00:04:35,705
My dad points it out
every time we drive by.

76
00:04:35,808 --> 00:04:38,902
Mr. Simpson, uh, maybe you should
actually go up there.

77
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:40,343
Huh?

78
00:04:42,015 --> 00:04:44,848
Oh, Mom. I'm sorry
I never come to see you.

79
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:46,851
I'm just not a cemetery person.

80
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:49,217
"Here lies"-

81
00:04:49,322 --> 00:04:51,153
Walt Whitman?

82
00:04:51,257 --> 00:04:53,623
Damn you, Walt Whitman!

83
00:04:53,726 --> 00:04:57,753
I... hate... you,
Walt... freakin'... Whitman!

84
00:04:57,864 --> 00:04:59,764
<i>Leaves of Grass my ass!</i>

85
00:04:59,866 --> 00:05:01,766
Wait a minute.

86
00:05:01,868 --> 00:05:04,029
Maybe it's that other grave.

87
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:06,537
The one that says "Simpson. "

88
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,698
Oh!

89
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:11,436
Why does my death keep
coming back to haunt me?

90
00:05:11,544 --> 00:05:13,307
Oh!

91
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,710
You awful, awful man!

92
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:19,979
- Get out of my son's grave!
- I hate to rain on your parade, lady.

93
00:05:20,086 --> 00:05:24,284
But this is my grave.
Hey-Wait a minute!

94
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:27,484
- Mom?
- Homer?

95
00:05:30,596 --> 00:05:34,225
<i>- I thought you were dead.
- I thought you were dead.</i>

96
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:39,067
Well, dang blast it! Isn't anybody in this
dad-gummed cemetery dead?

97
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:42,630
I didn't want to cause a fuss,
but now that you mention it.

98
00:05:44,777 --> 00:05:46,677
Oh.

99
00:05:46,779 --> 00:05:49,976
Homer, you grew up so handsome.

100
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:52,244
Some people say
I look like Dan Aykroyd.

101
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,620
I can't believe you're here.

102
00:05:55,722 --> 00:05:58,247
Dad always told me you died
while I was at the movies.

103
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:01,521
Oh! Oh, my poor baby.

104
00:06:01,627 --> 00:06:03,754
You must've been so upset.

105
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:06,263
But I suppose Abe had his reasons.

106
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:08,857
Yeah. Well, where have
you been all this time?

107
00:06:08,968 --> 00:06:11,869
Oh, it's a very complicated story.

108
00:06:11,971 --> 00:06:14,166
Let's just enjoy this moment.

109
00:06:14,273 --> 00:06:16,332
Mom, there's something
you should know about me.

110
00:06:16,442 --> 00:06:18,342
I almost always
spoil the moment.

111
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:24,907
- I'm sorry.
- That's okay, darling.

112
00:06:25,017 --> 00:06:27,815
It wasn't your fault.

113
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:31,321
Hey, everybody!
I got a big surprise for you!

114
00:06:31,424 --> 00:06:33,949
Presenting... my mother!

115
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:37,787
- You're kidding!
- That's Grandma Simpson?

116
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:39,990
- Can you believe it?
- I thought she was-

117
00:06:40,099 --> 00:06:42,226
- Hello.
- This is so weird.

118
00:06:42,335 --> 00:06:45,566
<i>It's like something out of Dickens.
Or Melrose Place.</i>

119
00:06:45,671 --> 00:06:48,037
Where have you been, Granny?
They freeze you or something?

120
00:06:48,141 --> 00:06:51,235
Oh, my!
Such clever grandchildren.

121
00:06:51,344 --> 00:06:54,780
So full of questions
and bright, shiny eyes.

122
00:06:54,881 --> 00:06:57,679
I don't know what to say.
I finally have a mother-in-law.

123
00:06:57,784 --> 00:07:02,118
No more living
vicariously through my girlfriends.

124
00:07:02,221 --> 00:07:04,519
Hey!

125
00:07:04,624 --> 00:07:07,593
Since you were a no-show
at all the big moments of my life...

126
00:07:07,693 --> 00:07:10,355
you owe me years
of back presents!

127
00:07:10,463 --> 00:07:13,796
Christmases, birthdays, Easters,
Kwanzaas, good report cards.

128
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:17,267
Hmm, 75 bucks a pop
plus interest and penalties.

129
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:19,395
You owe me... $22,000.

130
00:07:19,505 --> 00:07:21,973
<i>I'll Kwanzaa you.!</i>

131
00:07:23,376 --> 00:07:25,310
Homer, don't be
so hard on little-

132
00:07:25,411 --> 00:07:27,311
What is his name?

133
00:07:27,413 --> 00:07:30,143
This is my room.
This is my dresser.

134
00:07:30,249 --> 00:07:32,649
It's where I keep my shirts
when I'm not wearing them.

135
00:07:32,752 --> 00:07:34,811
Oh, yes.
Right in the drawers.

136
00:07:37,657 --> 00:07:40,353
You remembered.

137
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:43,258
Oh, I've missed
moments like this...

138
00:07:43,362 --> 00:07:45,227
Mom.

139
00:07:45,331 --> 00:07:48,767
I saw all your awards, Lisa.
They're mighty impressive.

140
00:07:48,868 --> 00:07:50,995
Aw, I just keep
'em out to bug Bart.

141
00:07:51,103 --> 00:07:53,162
Don't be bashful.
When I was your age...

142
00:07:53,272 --> 00:07:56,173
kids made fun of me because
I read at the ninth-grade level.

143
00:07:56,275 --> 00:07:58,436
- Me too!
- Hey, Mom!

144
00:07:58,544 --> 00:08:00,569
Look at me!
Look at what I can do!

145
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:03,513
I see you, Homer.
That's very nice.

146
00:08:03,616 --> 00:08:07,609
<i>Although, I hardly consider
A Separate Peace the ninth-grade level.</i>

147
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,347
Yeah, more like preschool.

148
00:08:09,455 --> 00:08:11,355
- I hateJohn Knowles.
- Me too.

149
00:08:16,762 --> 00:08:19,356
Mom, you're not looking!

150
00:08:19,465 --> 00:08:23,196
You know, Lisa, I feel like I have
an instant rapport with you.

151
00:08:23,302 --> 00:08:25,668
You didn't dumb it down.

152
00:08:25,771 --> 00:08:28,035
You said "rapport. "

153
00:08:29,876 --> 00:08:31,901
Gotta run!
Grandma stuff!

154
00:08:35,581 --> 00:08:37,481
Huh?

155
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:42,013
There. Now no one should be able to hear us.

156
00:08:42,121 --> 00:08:45,215
- What?
- All right. We don't need the dryer.

157
00:08:45,324 --> 00:08:48,054
- What?
- Just shut up and listen!

158
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,094
There's something
fishy about Grandma.

159
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:53,632
Whenever we ask her where she's been
all this time, she changes the subject.

160
00:08:53,733 --> 00:08:57,066
And just now when a police car drove by,
she ran into the house.

161
00:08:57,169 --> 00:08:58,966
Yeah, I don't
trust her either.

162
00:08:59,071 --> 00:09:01,005
I was going through her purse.
Look what I found.

163
00:09:01,107 --> 00:09:03,871
"Mona Simpson.
Mona Stevens.

164
00:09:03,976 --> 00:09:05,705
"Martha Stewart.
Penelope Olsen.

165
00:09:05,811 --> 00:09:06,874
Muddy Mae Suggins?"

166
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:14,182
These are the calling cards
of a con artist.

167
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:16,778
Woo-hoo! I'm so glad
to have my mom back.

168
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:19,380
I never realized
how much I missed her.

169
00:09:19,492 --> 00:09:22,655
- She's nice.
- But?

170
00:09:22,762 --> 00:09:24,992
I just don't think you
should get too excited...

171
00:09:25,097 --> 00:09:27,463
about the woman who
abandoned you for 25 years.

172
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:31,765
- You could get hurt again.
- First, it wasn't 25 years.

173
00:09:31,871 --> 00:09:36,001
It was 27 years. And second,
she had a very good reason.

174
00:09:36,108 --> 00:09:38,906
- Which was?
- I don't know.

175
00:09:39,011 --> 00:09:42,447
I guess I was just a horrible son
and no mother would want me.

176
00:09:42,548 --> 00:09:44,448
<i>Oh, Homie.</i>

177
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:46,711
Come on! You're a sweet,
kind, loving man.

178
00:09:46,819 --> 00:09:49,049
I'm sure you were
a wonderful son.

179
00:09:49,155 --> 00:09:52,522
- Then why did she leave me?
- Let's find out.

180
00:09:55,227 --> 00:09:59,061
Mother Simpson, we'd like to ask you
a few questions about your past.

181
00:09:59,165 --> 00:10:01,360
Can't reminisce. Sleeping.

182
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:05,867
Spill it, Muddy Mae,
or we're calling the cops!

183
00:10:05,972 --> 00:10:08,406
- Please don't!
- All right. Then we'll call your husband.

184
00:10:08,507 --> 00:10:11,032
- Grampa!
- No! I'll talk!

185
00:10:11,143 --> 00:10:13,737
I'll tell you everything.
I've wanted to tell you.

186
00:10:13,846 --> 00:10:17,282
It all started in the '60s.

187
00:10:18,985 --> 00:10:20,885
Take out wrenched ankle.

188
00:10:22,054 --> 00:10:23,954
Mom! Mom!

189
00:10:24,056 --> 00:10:26,547
Mom!

190
00:10:26,659 --> 00:10:28,559
Oh, my little Homie Bear.

191
00:10:30,096 --> 00:10:33,429
- Time for bed.
- Sing me my bedtime song, Mom.

192
00:10:39,505 --> 00:10:41,405
Mm.

193
00:10:41,507 --> 00:10:43,065
Darn tootin'!

194
00:10:45,678 --> 00:10:47,612
Here's the tricky part.

195
00:10:52,885 --> 00:10:54,944
Abe, isn't Homer cute?

196
00:10:55,054 --> 00:10:57,386
Probably. I'm trying
to watch the Super Bowl.

197
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,856
If people don't support this thing,
it might not make it.

198
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:02,757
Joe Willie Namath
swaggering off the field...

199
00:11:02,862 --> 00:11:07,299
his sideburns an apogee
of sculpted "sartorium"-

200
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:10,369
the foppish follicles pioneered
by Ambrose Burnside...

201
00:11:10,469 --> 00:11:12,937
Appomattox, 1865.

202
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:21,109
<i>His wild, untamed facial hair...</i>

203
00:11:21,213 --> 00:11:24,979
<i>revealed a new world
of rebellion, of change-</i>

204
00:11:25,084 --> 00:11:28,417
<i>- a world where doors
were open for women like me.</i>

205
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:30,421
<i>But Abe was stuck
in his button-down...</i>

206
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:32,991
<i>Plastic Fantastic Madison Avenue scene.</i>

207
00:11:33,092 --> 00:11:36,118
Look at them sideburns!
He looks like a girl.

208
00:11:36,228 --> 00:11:39,891
Now, Johnny Unitas- there's a haircut
you could set your watch to.

209
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:44,163
So, Mother Simpson, where did your
newfound sense of irresponsibility take you?

210
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:47,467
I soon found people who shared
my views at the state college.

211
00:11:48,641 --> 00:11:52,042
<i>Anthrax, gangrene,
swimmer's ear.</i>

212
00:11:52,144 --> 00:11:55,341
Get your germ lab out of here!

213
00:11:55,448 --> 00:11:58,042
<i>- Now! Now!
How could I not become a radical...</i>

214
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:00,448
<i>when we were fighting
a force of pure evil?</i>

215
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:04,421
<i>Hey, hey, Mr. Burns.!
Enough already with the germs.</i>

216
00:12:04,523 --> 00:12:06,423
Ptooh their flower power-

217
00:12:06,525 --> 00:12:09,255
<i>it's no match for my glower power.</i>

218
00:12:12,998 --> 00:12:15,228
Well, that's some
nice glowering, Mr. "B."

219
00:12:15,334 --> 00:12:18,326
<i>We'd met the enemy,
and it was Montgomery Burns.</i>

220
00:12:18,437 --> 00:12:22,396
<i>Drastic action had to be taken
to stop his war machine.</i>

221
00:12:22,508 --> 00:12:26,274
I put Homer to bed, Abe.
And now I'm going out.

222
00:12:26,378 --> 00:12:30,371
- It could be a late night. I'm meeting my destiny.
- So long.

223
00:12:37,823 --> 00:12:42,487
When this baby goes off,
Burns's lab is gonna be history, man!

224
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:46,053
Germ history!

225
00:12:46,165 --> 00:12:48,065
Oh, man!
I got the munchies.

226
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:09,444
Oh! No!

227
00:13:09,555 --> 00:13:11,989
Wait a minute.

228
00:13:12,091 --> 00:13:15,356
Bronchial tubes clearing.
Asthma disappearing.

229
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:19,192
Acne... remains.
But asthma disappearing.

230
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:21,766
My germs!

231
00:13:21,867 --> 00:13:25,598
My precious germs! They never harmed a soul.
They never even had a chance.

232
00:13:25,704 --> 00:13:29,003
Whoever did this
will never get past me.

233
00:13:32,545 --> 00:13:36,845
You poor man.
Let me help you up.

234
00:13:38,918 --> 00:13:41,250
You just made
a very big mistake.

235
00:13:41,353 --> 00:13:43,753
You'll spend the rest
of your life in pri-

236
00:13:43,856 --> 00:13:46,723
My asthma's gone!
Listen to me breathe.

237
00:13:51,463 --> 00:13:55,593
<i>From that moment on,
my life as I knew it was over.</i>

238
00:13:55,701 --> 00:13:58,261
Only one member of the Springfield Seven
was identified.

239
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:00,702
She's been described
as a woman in her early 30s...

240
00:14:00,806 --> 00:14:04,003
yellow complexion
and may be extremely helpful.

241
00:14:04,109 --> 00:14:07,044
<i>For Channel 6 News,
I'm Kenny Brockelstein.</i>

242
00:14:07,146 --> 00:14:09,046
Homer.

243
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,620
I'll miss you, Homer.

244
00:14:20,659 --> 00:14:23,150
I thought
I dreamed that kiss.

245
00:14:24,797 --> 00:14:27,357
I'm so sorry
I misjudged you, Mom.

246
00:14:27,466 --> 00:14:29,934
You had to leave
to protect your family.

247
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:33,835
- How did you survive?
- Oh, I had help from my friends in the underground.

248
00:14:33,939 --> 00:14:37,340
Jerry Rubin gave me a job marketing
his line of health shakes...

249
00:14:37,443 --> 00:14:39,673
I proofread
Bobby Seale's cookbook...

250
00:14:39,778 --> 00:14:42,679
and I ran credit checks
at Tom Hayden's Porsche dealership.

251
00:14:42,781 --> 00:14:46,012
Wait a minute.
There's one thing I don't understand.

252
00:14:46,118 --> 00:14:49,349
In all those years, why didn't you
ever try to contact me?

253
00:14:49,455 --> 00:14:52,686
But I did. I sent you
a care package every week.

254
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:55,988
Oh, come on, Mom. We use that same line
on the kids when they're at camp.

255
00:14:56,095 --> 00:14:58,723
But I did. I really did.
I'll prove it to you.

256
00:15:02,201 --> 00:15:04,965
- Any undelivered mail for HomerJ. Simpson?
- No.

257
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:06,970
Oh, wait. This.

258
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:09,870
That's what happens when you don't
tip your letter carrier at Christmas.

259
00:15:09,975 --> 00:15:13,741
Yes, I'd like to send this letter to
the Prussian consulate in Siam by aeromail.

260
00:15:13,846 --> 00:15:15,939
Am I too late
for the 4:30 autogiro?

261
00:15:16,048 --> 00:15:19,882
- Um, better look in the manual.
- Ignorance.

262
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:24,722
Wait a minute.
I know that woman.

263
00:15:24,823 --> 00:15:28,315
But from when?
And in what capacity?

264
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:30,486
<i>It's her.!</i>

265
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:33,326
- At last!
- This book must be out of date.

266
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:36,492
I don't see Prussia,
Siam or autogiro.

267
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:39,696
Keep looking!

268
00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:45,739
Are you sure this is the woman
you saw in the post office?

269
00:15:45,844 --> 00:15:48,335
Absolutely. Who could forget
such a monstrous visage?

270
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:52,008
She has the sloping brow
and cranial bumpage of the career criminal.

271
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:55,382
Uh, sir, phrenology was dismissed
as quackery 160 years ago.

272
00:15:55,487 --> 00:15:59,184
Of course you'd say that. You have
the brainpan of a stagecoach tilter.

273
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:02,158
At any rate, the F.B.I. will track down
this mystery woman...

274
00:16:02,261 --> 00:16:04,889
and put her
behind bars.

275
00:16:06,198 --> 00:16:08,359
- How does it happen, Joe?
- How does what happen?

276
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:10,526
How does a sweet young lady
mortgage her future...

277
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:13,867
for a bunch of scraggly ideals
and greasy-haired promises?

278
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:17,101
Maybe she thought the war in Southeast Asia
was so immoral her end justified the means.

279
00:16:17,209 --> 00:16:21,805
Gee, Joe. You haven't been the same
since your son went crazy in Vietnam.

280
00:16:21,914 --> 00:16:23,973
It's a pain that never ends.

281
00:16:35,594 --> 00:16:38,620
- Seven!
- No, Dad. It's a rhetorical question.

282
00:16:38,731 --> 00:16:40,358
Rhetorical, eh?

283
00:16:40,466 --> 00:16:43,492
- Eight!
- Dad, do you even know what "rhetorical" means?

284
00:16:43,602 --> 00:16:45,467
Do I know what
rhetorical means?

285
00:16:45,571 --> 00:16:48,563
<i>Quick, Grandma! Hide!</i>

286
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:56,644
No door is gonna
keep me from my meddlin'!

287
00:16:56,749 --> 00:16:58,649
Stand up straight, Bart.

288
00:16:58,751 --> 00:17:00,548
Abe?

289
00:17:00,652 --> 00:17:02,984
What the-

290
00:17:03,088 --> 00:17:05,454
Now, here's a piece
of bad news.

291
00:17:05,557 --> 00:17:09,254
Oh, Abe!
You've aged terribly.

292
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:13,024
What do you expect? You left me
to raise the boy on my own!

293
00:17:13,132 --> 00:17:16,260
I had to leave! But you didn't
have to tell Homer I was dead!

294
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:21,067
It was either that or tell him
his mother was a wanted criminal!

295
00:17:21,173 --> 00:17:26,372
You were a rotten wife,
and I'll never ever forgive you!

296
00:17:27,946 --> 00:17:29,811
Can we have sex?
Please?

297
00:17:29,915 --> 00:17:33,146
- Oh, Abe!
- Well, I tried. What's for supper?

298
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:38,717
Yeah. I might've seen her. It's hard to tell
from this old picture, you know?

299
00:17:38,824 --> 00:17:40,985
Well, according to
our computer-aging program...

300
00:17:41,093 --> 00:17:43,186
she should look about...

301
00:17:43,295 --> 00:17:44,790
25 years older.

302
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:52,560
Yeah, I seen her. Uh,
that is to say, I saw her.

303
00:17:52,671 --> 00:17:55,071
Look at me, Grandma.
I'm a hippie. Peace, man.

304
00:17:55,174 --> 00:17:56,869
Groovy.
Bomb Vietnam!

305
00:17:56,975 --> 00:17:58,875
Four more years!
Up with people!

306
00:17:58,977 --> 00:18:01,810
You know, Grandma, I used to think
maybe I was adopted.

307
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:04,348
I couldn't understand
how I fit into this family.

308
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:08,716
Now that I've met you,
I suddenly make a lot of sense.

309
00:18:08,821 --> 00:18:14,726
I'm so glad to see the spirit of the '60s
is still alive in you kids.

310
00:18:23,335 --> 00:18:25,269
Yep.
I saw her.

311
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:27,395
That is to say,
I seen her.

312
00:18:27,506 --> 00:18:29,235
She seemed like a nice lady.

313
00:18:29,341 --> 00:18:33,243
Well, that nice lady set the cause
of biological warfare back 30 years.

314
00:18:33,345 --> 00:18:35,313
We're only now
finally caught up.

315
00:18:35,414 --> 00:18:38,042
Two more ladies
come by earlier that day.

316
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:41,347
One was real pretty.

317
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:43,353
Tother, sort of plain.

318
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:48,419
Ma'am, we're gonna need your assistance
in locating this individual.

319
00:18:48,527 --> 00:18:52,019
You're fresh.

320
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:54,531
Don't you want to play
"good cop, bad cop"?

321
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:58,330
- Ma'am, we're all good cops.
- I had no intention of playing the good cop.

322
00:18:59,771 --> 00:19:02,171
Look, we know
you bought the tombstone.

323
00:19:02,274 --> 00:19:06,506
We know the fugitive visited that tombstone.
Whose tombstone was it?

324
00:19:06,612 --> 00:19:08,671
Just lift up
your coffee cups and see.

325
00:19:11,183 --> 00:19:13,743
- Good lord!
- Put out an A.P. B...

326
00:19:13,852 --> 00:19:17,015
on a Uosdwis R. Dewoh.

327
00:19:17,122 --> 00:19:19,022
Uh, better start
with Greek town.

328
00:19:19,124 --> 00:19:21,718
That's HomerJ. Simpson, Chief.
You're reading it upside down.

329
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:23,988
Uh, cancel that A.P.B.

330
00:19:24,096 --> 00:19:26,656
But, uh- Oh, bring back
some of them, uh, gyros.

331
00:19:26,765 --> 00:19:29,825
Uh, Chief, you're
talking into your wallet.

332
00:19:29,935 --> 00:19:32,904
Grandma, have you ever thought
about moving back to Springfield?

333
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:35,530
You could live with Grampa again.

334
00:19:39,578 --> 00:19:42,206
Oh, I'm a living joke.

335
00:19:42,314 --> 00:19:44,214
You know, Lisa...

336
00:19:44,316 --> 00:19:46,978
<i>it might be nice to rest for a while.</i>

337
00:19:47,085 --> 00:19:49,952
<i>Mom, there's nothing
to be alarmed about.</i>

338
00:19:50,055 --> 00:19:53,047
But could you take one last look
at the family and join me in the kitchen?

339
00:19:55,427 --> 00:19:59,989
I've been waiting
25 years for this moment.

340
00:20:03,168 --> 00:20:05,068
<i>Huh?</i>

341
00:20:08,674 --> 00:20:10,665
I'm sorry, sir.
I must've taped over that.

342
00:20:15,948 --> 00:20:18,508
Freeze! F.B.I.
The jig is up.

343
00:20:18,617 --> 00:20:21,677
All right, I admit it.
I am the Lindbergh baby.

344
00:20:21,787 --> 00:20:25,279
Waah! Waah! Goo, goo.
I miss my fly-fly dada.

345
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:27,358
Are you trying to stall us,
or are you just senile?

346
00:20:27,459 --> 00:20:30,292
A little from column "A,"
a little from column "B."

347
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:32,795
Sir, she's gone!

348
00:20:37,603 --> 00:20:41,596
- We made it, Homer!
- It's all thanks to our anonymous tipster.

349
00:20:41,707 --> 00:20:44,642
But who are you?
And why did you tip us off?

350
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:48,110
Well, it's 'cause of your old lady
that I got rid of the asthma...

351
00:20:48,213 --> 00:20:50,443
- that was keeping me out of the academy.
- Thanks.

352
00:20:50,549 --> 00:20:53,074
Sure. Just think of me
as an anonymous friend...

353
00:20:53,185 --> 00:20:55,949
who rose through the ranks
of the Springfield Police...

354
00:20:56,054 --> 00:20:58,022
to become
Chief Clancy Wig-

355
00:20:58,123 --> 00:21:01,149
Yak, yak.
Yak, yak, yak.

356
00:21:02,527 --> 00:21:05,189
Well, there's my ride.

357
00:21:05,297 --> 00:21:07,390
The underground awaits.

358
00:21:07,499 --> 00:21:10,957
At least this time
I'm awake for your good-bye.

359
00:21:11,069 --> 00:21:12,866
Oh, Homer.

360
00:21:12,971 --> 00:21:16,964
Remember, whatever happens,
you have a mother...

361
00:21:17,075 --> 00:21:19,441
and she's truly
proud of you.

362
00:21:23,382 --> 00:21:25,509
<i>Oh.! Hurry up, man.!</i>

363
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:29,109
This electric van only
has 20 minutes of juice left!

364
00:21:30,822 --> 00:21:33,689
- Don't forget me!
- Don't worry, Homer.

365
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:36,090
You'll always be
a part of me.

366
00:21:36,194 --> 00:21:38,094
D'oh!

367
00:22:41,993 --> 00:22:43,927
Shh!

368
00:22:44,927 --> 00:22:54,927

00:00:03,903 --> 00:00:07,202
<i>The Simpsons</i>

2
00:00:15,415 --> 00:00:17,508
D'oh!

3
00:00:33,433 --> 00:00:37,767
I'd like to thank everybody who contributed
to Krusty's Canned Food Drive.

4
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:39,805
Your generous donations...

5
00:00:39,906 --> 00:00:44,343
have made this our slipperiest,
slimiest slobstacle course ever!

6
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:52,043
<i>Our contestants will drop out of my nose
and blurp into a tub of refried beans.</i>

7
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:58,921
From there, they'll stumble down
a sluice of rich, eggy béarnaise sauce.

8
00:00:59,025 --> 00:01:02,756
- How can we afford it? It's rancid!
- Uhh-

9
00:01:02,862 --> 00:01:04,762
And at the finish line...

10
00:01:04,864 --> 00:01:08,322
a scrumptious parfait of pudding,
pickle brine and detergent...

11
00:01:08,435 --> 00:01:12,872
where a writhing pile of kids
will grope blindly for hot dogs!

12
00:01:12,972 --> 00:01:15,702
Krusty, please! It burns!

13
00:01:18,111 --> 00:01:21,137
Oh, just think, Lise. That's our pickle brine
burning Sideshow Mel.

14
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:23,909
That Sideshow Mel thinks he's so big.

15
00:01:24,017 --> 00:01:25,985
Whatever happened
to Sideshow Bob?

16
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:27,986
Don't you remember, Dad?

17
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:31,421
<i>He framed Krusty,
he tried to kill Aunt Selma...</i>

18
00:01:31,524 --> 00:01:33,355
<i>he rigged an election-</i>

19
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:35,394
<i>And he tried to murder me.!</i>

20
00:01:35,495 --> 00:01:37,395
Oh, yeah.

21
00:01:37,497 --> 00:01:41,991
But what I'll mainly remember is the laughter.
I wonder what he's doing now.

22
00:01:44,304 --> 00:01:46,864
Ah, Westminster Abbey.

23
00:01:46,973 --> 00:01:49,908
Edward the Confessor himself
could not have done better.

24
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:53,410
Now to set the clocks
to Greenwich mean time.

25
00:01:55,515 --> 00:01:58,484
<i>My dear abbey!</i>

26
00:02:02,055 --> 00:02:05,547
<i>This is the way we mop the floor,
mop the floor mop the floor</i>

27
00:02:05,658 --> 00:02:09,856
Oh, must you bray night and day
at that infernal television?

28
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:13,797
- Oh, look who's talking.
- Yeah, Bob. You used to be on this show.

29
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,800
Don't remind me!

30
00:02:15,902 --> 00:02:20,669
My foolish capering destroyed more young
minds than syphilis and pinball combined.

31
00:02:20,773 --> 00:02:24,800
Oh, how I loathe that box...

32
00:02:24,911 --> 00:02:29,280
that omnidirectional
sludge pump droning and burping-

33
00:02:29,382 --> 00:02:31,942
Look here! That's enough now!
I own 60% of that network!

34
00:02:32,051 --> 00:02:34,918
All right, break it up, boys.
It's time for work detail.

35
00:02:35,021 --> 00:02:38,548
<i>I suppose you don't like
tabloid newspapers either.</i>

36
00:02:45,265 --> 00:02:48,530
There. That's the last
condom wrapper.

37
00:02:51,571 --> 00:02:55,974
Oh, I renew my objection
to this pointless endeavor.

38
00:02:56,075 --> 00:02:58,908
Informally now
and by affidavit later, time permitting.

39
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:02,778
Shut your word-hole!
We gotta get this place clean for the air show.

40
00:03:02,882 --> 00:03:08,081
Air show? Buzz-cut Alabamians spewing
colored smoke from their whizz jets...

41
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:11,419
to the strains of
"Rock You Like a Hurricane"?

42
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:15,517
What kind of country-fried rube
is still impressed by that?

43
00:03:19,232 --> 00:03:21,166
- Yeah!
- Yeah.

44
00:03:21,267 --> 00:03:23,428
I want to meet the first female
stealth bomber pilot.

45
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:27,302
During the Gulf War, she destroyed
70 mosques. And her name is Lisa too.

46
00:03:27,407 --> 00:03:30,865
I want to see some birds get sucked
into the engines, rare ones.

47
00:03:30,977 --> 00:03:34,208
<i>- This year I'm making ear plugs
out of biscuit dough.</i>

48
00:03:34,314 --> 00:03:36,646
They're ready.

49
00:03:38,618 --> 00:03:41,883
<i>So weary.</i>

50
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:49,718
<i>Grandma, this is my friend, Craig.</i>

51
00:03:51,965 --> 00:03:54,661
<i>Friend? You mean you two
aren't knocking boots?</i>

52
00:03:57,503 --> 00:03:59,664
<i>Ever do the back-seat mambo, Craigie?</i>

53
00:03:59,772 --> 00:04:01,672
I know that voice.

54
00:04:01,774 --> 00:04:05,972
TV's bottomless chum bucket
has claimed Vanessa Redgrave!

55
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:08,809
<i>Now I'm gonna haul ass to Lollapalooza.</i>

56
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:11,748
<i>Yee-haw.!</i>

57
00:04:11,851 --> 00:04:14,183
<i>Farewell, dear 'Nessa.</i>

58
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:24,696
<i>Hey, you.! The state's not paying you
five cents an hour to stand around.</i>

59
00:04:24,797 --> 00:04:27,425
- Now, get busy!
- Oh, I'll get busy.

60
00:04:27,533 --> 00:04:29,899
I'll get very busy, indeed.

61
00:04:36,542 --> 00:04:38,533
You still got it, Bob.

62
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,505
Way to guard
the parking lot, Top Gun!

63
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:44,606
I have three medals for this.

64
00:04:48,187 --> 00:04:51,645
Hey! Where is Sideshow Bob and that guy who,
uh, eats people and takes their faces?

65
00:04:51,758 --> 00:04:54,989
- I'm right here, Chief.
- Oh. Then where's Sideshow Bob?

66
00:04:55,094 --> 00:04:58,086
- Uh, he ran off.
- Oh, great.

67
00:04:58,197 --> 00:05:02,531
Well, if anyone asks, uh,
I beat him to death, okay?

68
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:04,603
Right.

69
00:05:10,243 --> 00:05:12,677
At this point in time,
I would like to direct your attention...

70
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:15,577
to the particular air vehicle next
to which I am currently standing.

71
00:05:15,682 --> 00:05:19,482
The Harrier jet is one of our more
dollar-intensive, ordnance-delivery vectors.

72
00:05:19,585 --> 00:05:22,019
Five tires?
Am I seeing things?

73
00:05:22,121 --> 00:05:24,021
Uh, and although
it looks complicated...

74
00:05:24,123 --> 00:05:26,387
it's so well-designed,
even a child could fly it.

75
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:28,460
- Can I fly it?
- Of course you cannot.

76
00:05:31,698 --> 00:05:35,259
Free Duff? Viva life!

77
00:05:41,908 --> 00:05:44,502
<i>Mm. Uhh-</i>

78
00:05:50,116 --> 00:05:52,175
Take that, Mom!

79
00:05:52,285 --> 00:05:54,515
Take that, Dad!

80
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:57,145
Send me to a psychiatrist,
will you?

81
00:05:57,256 --> 00:05:59,884
Take that, Dr. Sally Waxler!

82
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:09,726
Uh, Colonel, they're expecting you
at the podium in 10 minutes.

83
00:06:09,836 --> 00:06:12,999
I'm, uh-

84
00:06:22,615 --> 00:06:24,879
<i>Hmm.</i>

85
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:29,078
What in the World
According to Garp?

86
00:06:29,188 --> 00:06:31,349
Those are my dress towels!

87
00:06:32,692 --> 00:06:36,458
Who's in my private washroom?
McGuckett, let me in.

88
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:39,190
<i>- The door already is closed.
- What?</i>

89
00:06:39,298 --> 00:06:41,994
This is Colonel Leslie "Hap" Hapablap.

90
00:06:42,101 --> 00:06:46,697
If you don't open that door, I'll tear you up
like a Kleenex at a snot party!

91
00:06:46,806 --> 00:06:48,603
You say you're in the military?

92
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:52,804
<i>Sweet Enola Gay, son!
I'm gonna come in there and corpse you up!</i>

93
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:55,813
Corpse you up
and mail you to mama!

94
00:06:57,483 --> 00:07:00,350
Well, where'd he go?

95
00:07:00,453 --> 00:07:04,549
Oh, got my knuckles
all lined up for nothing.

96
00:07:06,659 --> 00:07:08,627
Sorry, ladies.

97
00:07:12,965 --> 00:07:16,628
- Look at that hunk of junk.
- Not jun-

98
00:07:16,736 --> 00:07:20,172
You're ignorant!
That's the Wright Brothers' plane.

99
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:22,366
At Kitty Hawk in 1903...

100
00:07:22,475 --> 00:07:27,174
Charles Lindbergh flew it 15 miles
on a thimbleful of corn oil.

101
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,908
Single-handedly won us
the Civil War, it did.

102
00:07:30,016 --> 00:07:31,984
So, how do you know so much
about American history?

103
00:07:32,084 --> 00:07:34,917
I pieced it together
mostly from sugar packets.

104
00:07:38,357 --> 00:07:41,155
Authorization code?

105
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:43,524
Code? Son, this is Colonel Hapablap!

106
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:47,429
That fool McGuckett sprayed runway foam
all over Chuck Yeager's Acura.

107
00:07:47,533 --> 00:07:49,626
Now get down there with
the chamois triple-time!

108
00:07:49,735 --> 00:07:52,568
<i>- But, Colonel, I'm under strict orders to-
- Sweet Enola Gay, son!</i>

109
00:07:52,672 --> 00:07:57,371
Get moving or I'll tear you up
like a Kleenex at a, uh, snot party.

110
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:59,172
Sir, right away, sir!

111
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:08,817
They didn't have any aspirin,
so I got you some cigarettes.

112
00:08:08,921 --> 00:08:13,187
Maybe my headache
will go away once the show starts.

113
00:08:13,292 --> 00:08:17,319
<i>Uh, ladies and gentlemen...</i>

114
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:20,228
what a day for an air show!

115
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:23,359
<i>Not a cloud in the sky.!</i>

116
00:08:23,469 --> 00:08:26,961
Except perhaps...
a mushroom cloud.

117
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:39,648
Oh, forget it.

118
00:08:42,154 --> 00:08:45,317
<i>To slip the surly bonds of Earth...</i>

119
00:08:45,424 --> 00:08:48,222
<i>and touch the face of God.</i>

120
00:08:48,327 --> 00:08:50,227
To fly!

121
00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:53,662
The dream of man
and flightless bird alike.

122
00:08:53,766 --> 00:08:56,428
And now, hold on tight...

123
00:08:56,536 --> 00:09:00,996
as we blast through the thrilling highlights
of aviation history!

124
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:08,408
<i>- Say! Did somebody say box kites?
- No.!</i>

125
00:09:11,417 --> 00:09:17,014
The common box kite was originally
used as a means of drying wet string.

126
00:09:27,867 --> 00:09:30,199
Do they have to play that rock music?

127
00:09:30,303 --> 00:09:33,431
Every note is pounding into my skull.

128
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:42,104
Anybody out there
feel the need for speed?

129
00:09:42,214 --> 00:09:44,307
- Yay!
- Yay.

130
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:48,410
Then get ready for the pride
of the United States Air Force!

131
00:09:48,521 --> 00:09:51,888
The British-made HarrierJump jet!

132
00:09:54,727 --> 00:09:56,991
Dad, why aren't you looking?

133
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:59,997
Why jerk my neck around like a goon...

134
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:02,192
when Tyranno-Vision decides
what I should look at?

135
00:10:02,301 --> 00:10:06,567
Ooh, look!
It's Maggie!

136
00:10:06,672 --> 00:10:08,936
<i>Uh, Maggie?</i>

137
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:11,339
Sideshow Bob!

138
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:13,412
Hello, Springfield.

139
00:10:13,512 --> 00:10:18,381
Sorry to divert your attention
from all the big noises and shiny things.

140
00:10:18,484 --> 00:10:22,250
But something's been troubling
me lately- television!

141
00:10:22,355 --> 00:10:26,587
<i>Wouldn't our lives be so much richer
if television were done away with?</i>

142
00:10:26,692 --> 00:10:30,025
- What?
- Surely he's not talking about VH1?

143
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:35,192
Why, we could revive the lost
arts of conversation... and scrimshaw.

144
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:39,738
Thus I submit to you,
we abolish television... permanently!

145
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:42,433
Go back to Massachusetts, pinko!

146
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:46,068
Oh, and one more thing.
I've stolen a nuclear weapon.

147
00:10:46,178 --> 00:10:49,545
If you do not rid this city
of television within two hours...

148
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,549
I will detonate it.

149
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:55,747
Farewell.

150
00:10:55,855 --> 00:10:59,586
By the way, I'm aware of the irony of
appearing on TV in order to decry it.

151
00:10:59,692 --> 00:11:02,126
So don't bother pointing that out.

152
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:07,089
Kids, everything's gonna be okay!
Don't panic! Just don't panic!

153
00:11:07,199 --> 00:11:10,259
Mom! Mom, you're stepping on my heels
and knocking my shoes off!

154
00:11:10,369 --> 00:11:12,394
We can always get more shoes.
Move, move, move!

155
00:11:14,707 --> 00:11:16,902
Stamp your hand for reentry.

156
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:20,911
Hey!

157
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:24,881
Cool! I want to be around
when those guns start going off.

158
00:11:24,984 --> 00:11:27,817
Bart! No!

159
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:31,913
- Wait! Wait! My children are in there!
- You must be very proud, ma'am.

160
00:11:35,327 --> 00:11:38,194
Our city will not negotiate
with terrorists.

161
00:11:38,297 --> 00:11:40,492
Is there a city nearby that will?

162
00:11:40,599 --> 00:11:45,195
No need, sir. We'll find that head case
faster than Garfield finds lasagna.

163
00:11:45,304 --> 00:11:50,071
<i>Oh. I'm sorry. My- My wife thought
that was gangbusters.</i>

164
00:11:55,648 --> 00:11:58,742
This elevator only goes to the basement.

165
00:11:58,851 --> 00:12:02,412
And someone made
an awful mess down there.

166
00:12:05,991 --> 00:12:07,959
<i>Watch out.!
He's got his probe.!</i>

167
00:12:13,132 --> 00:12:17,228
Bart! Bart! What are you doing?
We've got to get out of here!

168
00:12:17,336 --> 00:12:19,497
Target sighted!
Launching air-to-nerd missile!

169
00:12:19,605 --> 00:12:22,938
Ow! Come on!
Mom and Dad are waiting!

170
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:24,907
Bob is not here.

171
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:27,945
We have searched every
square inch of this base...

172
00:12:28,047 --> 00:12:31,278
and all we have found
is porno, porno, porno!

173
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,485
We have only 20 minutes left.

174
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:36,953
Send in the esteemed
representatives of television.

175
00:12:41,327 --> 00:12:44,728
Hey, hey! Now, this is
my kind of meeting!

176
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:49,062
Gentlemen, it's time we face up
to the un-face-up-to-able.

177
00:12:49,168 --> 00:12:53,696
We must sacrifice television in order
to save the lives of our townspeople.

178
00:12:53,806 --> 00:12:58,266
Whoa! Whoa-ho-ho!
Let's not go nuts!

179
00:12:58,377 --> 00:13:01,869
Would it really be worth living
in a world without television?

180
00:13:01,981 --> 00:13:05,439
I think the survivors
would envy the dead.

181
00:13:05,551 --> 00:13:10,045
<i>- I appreciate your passion
on behalf of your medium.</i>

182
00:13:10,156 --> 00:13:12,784
But I'm afraid we're out of options.

183
00:13:12,892 --> 00:13:14,985
Television must go.

184
00:13:15,094 --> 00:13:18,495
May God have mercy on our souls.

185
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:27,061
And as my final newscast
draws to a close...

186
00:13:27,173 --> 00:13:29,937
I'm reminded of a few of the events
that brought me closer to you.

187
00:13:30,042 --> 00:13:33,534
The collapse of the Soviet Union,
premium ice cream price wars...

188
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:38,242
dogs that were mistakenly issued major
credit cards and others who weren't so lucky.

189
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:40,784
And so, farewell.

190
00:13:40,886 --> 00:13:45,516
<i>Uh, and, uh, don't forget to look for
my new column in PC World magazine.</i>

191
00:13:56,569 --> 00:14:00,471
Success!
They're giving in!

192
00:14:00,573 --> 00:14:04,703
Blast! I should have
made more demands!

193
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:08,109
Some decent local marmalade,
for one. Oh, well, next time.

194
00:14:08,214 --> 00:14:10,478
Not my extendo-glove!

195
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:12,847
Oh, they haven't made those
since the war.

196
00:14:12,952 --> 00:14:15,580
Not- Oh, not
my Paris backdrop!

197
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:19,146
How am I gonna make fun of the Frogs?

198
00:14:19,258 --> 00:14:21,920
<i>Wait.</i>

199
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:24,291
If I could only stay on the air...

200
00:14:24,396 --> 00:14:26,864
I'd have 100% of the audience.

201
00:14:26,966 --> 00:14:29,196
Think of the ratings.

202
00:14:31,637 --> 00:14:33,628
Okay, so we can't go over the fence.

203
00:14:33,739 --> 00:14:36,640
I feel so helpless.
What if something happens to them?

204
00:14:36,742 --> 00:14:38,676
I'm sure they're fine, honey.

205
00:14:38,777 --> 00:14:41,439
Hmm. Well, at least they're
wearing clean underwear.

206
00:14:46,151 --> 00:14:48,312
Free and easy, Lise.

207
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:51,753
There's nothing like an unfurnished
basement for pure comfort.

208
00:14:51,857 --> 00:14:55,384
Huh? Hurry up.
Mom and Dad are probably worried sick.

209
00:14:55,494 --> 00:14:59,521
<i>Do you know what really frosts my Kelvinator?</i>

210
00:14:59,632 --> 00:15:03,227
That fruitcup's probably still laughing at us
from his damn hidey-hole.

211
00:15:03,335 --> 00:15:05,303
I'd rather take an order
from Bill Clinton...

212
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:08,430
than hear that guy's snooty,
high-toned voice again, sir.

213
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:12,135
"High-toned voice. "
Bart, that's it.

214
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:14,235
I know where
Sideshow Bob is hiding.

215
00:15:14,346 --> 00:15:18,715
When Bob broadcast that message,
his voice was higher than normal.

216
00:15:18,817 --> 00:15:20,785
And what makes your voice high?

217
00:15:20,886 --> 00:15:23,446
- Tight, binding underwear?
- Helium!

218
00:15:23,555 --> 00:15:25,648
Sideshow Bob
is in the Duff blimp!

219
00:15:27,793 --> 00:15:33,288
All Springfield trembles
before the might of Sideshow Bob.

220
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:36,129
Blasted helium!
Shoo! Shoo!

221
00:15:36,235 --> 00:15:38,931
Shoo! Shoo! That's better.

222
00:15:39,038 --> 00:15:43,338
Gone. Gone too.
Fabulous. Marvelous.

223
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:46,002
This is the emergency broadcast system.

224
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:48,011
Stand by for an urgent bulletin.

225
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:51,139
Hey, hey!

226
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:53,411
Krusty the Clown
is back on the air!

227
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:56,181
Eight- No, no!
Twelve hours a day!

228
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:58,449
The only game in town!

229
00:15:58,557 --> 00:16:01,025
Krusty! But how?

230
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:03,424
<i>Coming at you live
from the civil defense shack...</i>

231
00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:07,522
<i>in the remote Alkali Flats
of the Springfield badlands.</i>

232
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:10,864
I'll be beaming out
11 watts of wackiness!

233
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:14,133
Hour after hour of unscripted,
unrehearsed comedy...

234
00:16:14,239 --> 00:16:18,608
featuring, uh, you know, uh,
Professor Gas Can!

235
00:16:18,711 --> 00:16:22,807
Uh, and, uh, former president,
Ike Eisenhower!

236
00:16:22,915 --> 00:16:25,042
Let's get busy!

237
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:29,052
<i>Oh! My utopia lies in ruins.</i>

238
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:34,786
How naive of me to think a mere atom bomb
could fell the chattering Cyclops!

239
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:44,432
Well, at least I'll have my revenge!

240
00:16:44,536 --> 00:16:45,730
Bob, no!

241
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:48,705
Don't you see? That would
be taking the easy way out.

242
00:16:48,807 --> 00:16:52,038
I agree.

243
00:17:09,928 --> 00:17:13,659
"Best before November 1959."
Damn it, Bob!

244
00:17:13,766 --> 00:17:15,666
There were plenty
of brand-new bombs.

245
00:17:15,768 --> 00:17:18,259
But you had to go
for that retro '50s charm.

246
00:17:20,272 --> 00:17:24,140
Well, if it isn't
my arch nemesis, Bart Simpson...

247
00:17:24,243 --> 00:17:26,939
and his sister, Lisa,
to whom I'm fairly indifferent.

248
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:29,071
So Krusty double-crossed you.

249
00:17:29,181 --> 00:17:32,014
But your basic plan
was pure genius.

250
00:17:32,117 --> 00:17:34,847
Where do you get your ideas?

251
00:17:34,953 --> 00:17:37,387
Oh, please!
Let's not embarrass us both...

252
00:17:37,489 --> 00:17:41,016
with that hoary old
stall-the-villain-with-flattery scheme.

253
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:45,724
I- I should've known you were
too smart to fall for that.

254
00:17:45,831 --> 00:17:47,958
Really? What type of smart?
Book smart?

255
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:50,297
Because there are a lot of
people who are book smart.

256
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:52,370
But it takes a very special
type of genius to-

257
00:17:52,471 --> 00:17:55,440
<i>All right, Bob. It's over.!
Come out with your hands up.!</i>

258
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:58,704
No! How did they find me?

259
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:18,427
He's getting away!

260
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:23,331
- Oh, not the Harrier!
We've got a war tomorrow.

261
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:26,268
God bless the idiot-proof Air Force.

262
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:35,038
They're gone!

263
00:18:35,147 --> 00:18:37,945
Hell! Not the Wright Brothers' plane.

264
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:40,814
The Smithsonian's gonna
have my ass on a platter.

265
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:47,281
Dad! Help!

266
00:18:47,392 --> 00:18:52,091
Hang on, boy! Daddy's coming to save you!

267
00:18:52,197 --> 00:18:54,062
D'oh!

268
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:58,660
Mom! I found Sideshow Bob's hideout!
And I got a secret message to the police!

269
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:02,365
And I had a blimp fall on me!
And I was in an atomic blast! But I'm okay now!

270
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:06,706
Well, I wrecked the gate. But you don't
hear me bragging. Now let's roll!

271
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:14,919
Ah, for the days when aviation
was a gentleman's pursuit.

272
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:18,922
Back before everyJoe Sweat Sock could
wedge himself behind a lunch tray...

273
00:19:19,024 --> 00:19:21,356
and jet off to Raleigh-Durham.

274
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:24,861
Are you getting
lots of bugs in your mouth too?

275
00:19:24,963 --> 00:19:27,397
Yes.

276
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:31,769
Prepare to engage enemy.

277
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:35,636
Bogie's air speed not sufficient for
intercept. Suggest we get out and walk.

278
00:19:43,115 --> 00:19:45,106
Jump, boy!
I got you!

279
00:19:45,217 --> 00:19:48,050
I'm coming!

280
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,987
Now you, boy.

281
00:19:57,095 --> 00:20:00,656
You can't escape, Bob. If the tennis rackets
don't get you, the pool skimmers will.

282
00:20:00,766 --> 00:20:03,564
Oh, I- I never planned to escape.

283
00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:05,933
You see, this is a kamikaze mission.

284
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:09,474
You and I are going to
kill Krusty the Clown!

285
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:18,080
Kids, Itchy and Scratchy
can't be here today.

286
00:20:18,183 --> 00:20:21,209
But instead,
we've got the next best thing.

287
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,982
<i>It's The Stingy
and Battery Show.!</i>

288
00:20:24,089 --> 00:20:26,956
They bite and light
and bite and light and bite

289
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:29,823
You know what I'm talking about.

290
00:20:29,928 --> 00:20:32,123
<i>Uh-oh.</i>

291
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:34,756
You can't kill Krusty.
He made you what you are.

292
00:20:34,866 --> 00:20:38,893
- Without him, you wouldn't
even be called "Sideshow. "

293
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,408
What the hell is that?
A lawn mower?

294
00:20:45,711 --> 00:20:47,770
Get out of the way, Krusty!

295
00:20:55,721 --> 00:20:57,780
What is the freakin' holdup?

296
00:20:58,824 --> 00:21:01,224
Die, Krusty!

297
00:21:01,326 --> 00:21:03,851
Die- Oh.

298
00:21:07,165 --> 00:21:12,364
Ooh, sorry. Uh, we don't normally drive
these in the Air Force.

299
00:21:12,471 --> 00:21:16,271
Gotcha!
Ya TV-hatin' mutant.

300
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:19,071
What is your major malfunction,
Sideshow Bob?

301
00:21:19,177 --> 00:21:22,340
Oh, my little sugar bun.

302
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:24,915
I'm so glad you're safe.

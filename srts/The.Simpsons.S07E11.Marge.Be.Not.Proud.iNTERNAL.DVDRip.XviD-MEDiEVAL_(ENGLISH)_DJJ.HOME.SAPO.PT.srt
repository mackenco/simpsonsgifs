D'oh!

<i>It's a Krusty Kinda Kristmas.!</i>

Brought to you by I LG-

selling your body's chemicals after you die.

00:00:42,175 --> 00:00:46,009
And by Li'I Sweetheart Cupcakes,
a subsidiary of I LG.

7
00:00:46,112 --> 00:00:49,548
Oh, hi!
I didn't hear you come in.

8
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:53,949
Welcome to my home.
And- Ho-ho!

9
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:57,217
Say, did I hear some carolers?

10
00:01:02,529 --> 00:01:07,125
Hey! It's respected private citizen,
Tom Landry!

11
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:09,667
And South American sensation...

12
00:01:09,769 --> 00:01:13,728
Shooshisha- Shooshashi-

13
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,434
Shoosh- Oh, boy! Uhh!

14
00:01:16,543 --> 00:01:19,205
Now, stay tuned for a video Christmas card...

15
00:01:19,312 --> 00:01:21,280
from Tupac Shakur.

16
00:01:21,381 --> 00:01:23,508
Hey, I thought
Krusty was Jewish.

17
00:01:23,616 --> 00:01:27,882
Christmas is a time when people of all religions
come together to worshipJesus Christ.

18
00:01:34,027 --> 00:01:36,894
Boring!

19
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:41,801
Help!

20
00:01:41,901 --> 00:01:45,598
You want excitement?
Shove this up your stocking!

21
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:48,741
Ooh-hoo-whoa!

22
00:01:54,981 --> 00:01:58,473
- Hmm, that looks entertaining.
- Oh, yeah!

23
00:01:58,585 --> 00:02:01,645
So tell your folks,
"Buy me Bonestorm...

24
00:02:01,754 --> 00:02:04,154
or go to hell!"

25
00:02:04,257 --> 00:02:06,919
Buy me Bonestorm
or go to hell!

26
00:02:07,026 --> 00:02:10,826
- Bart!
- Young man, in this house we use a little word called "please. "

27
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:13,592
- It's the coolest video game ever.
- I'm sorry, honey...

28
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:17,329
but those games cost up to,
and including, $70.

29
00:02:17,437 --> 00:02:19,905
And they're violent,
and they distract you from your schoolwork.

30
00:02:20,006 --> 00:02:23,271
Those are all good points, but the problem is
they don't result in me getting the game.

31
00:02:23,376 --> 00:02:25,640
I know how you feel, Bart.
When I was your age...

32
00:02:25,745 --> 00:02:29,476
I wanted an electric football game
more than anything in the world.

33
00:02:29,582 --> 00:02:34,645
And my parents bought it for me,
and it was the happiest day of my life.

34
00:02:34,754 --> 00:02:36,722
Well, good night.

35
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:39,519
Oh, I'll never get that game.

36
00:02:39,626 --> 00:02:41,594
Tuck-in time!

37
00:02:41,694 --> 00:02:46,256
All aboard the sleepy train
to visit Mother Goose

38
00:02:46,366 --> 00:02:52,305
Barty's stop is Snoozy Lane
to rest his sweet caboose

39
00:02:52,405 --> 00:02:56,432
Mom, I'm not a little kid anymore.
Tuck-in time is lame.

40
00:02:56,543 --> 00:03:01,571
Well, if loving my kids is lame,
then I guess I'm just a big lame.

41
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:04,275
Mom, it's lame to be
proud of being lame.

42
00:03:04,384 --> 00:03:08,218
- Well, life is like a box of chocolates.
- Mom, no! Mom!

43
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:11,222
<i>You never know-</i>

44
00:03:11,324 --> 00:03:13,026
<i>what you're gonna get.</i>

45
00:03:13,061 --> 00:03:13,321
<i>what you're gonna get.</i>

46
00:03:16,796 --> 00:03:19,765
Ninety-nine cents?

47
00:03:21,167 --> 00:03:24,193
I want to buy a copy of Bonestorm.
Here's 99 cents.

48
00:03:24,304 --> 00:03:27,330
Allow me to summarize the proposed transaction.

49
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,068
You wish to purchase Bonestorm
for 99 cents.

50
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:33,771
Net profit to me, negative $59.

51
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:37,714
Oh, oh, please take my $59.
I don't want it. It's yours.

52
00:03:37,817 --> 00:03:41,651
Eh, eh, eh!
Seeing as we are unfamiliar with sarcasm...

53
00:03:41,754 --> 00:03:46,817
I shall close the register at this point
and state that 99 cents is the rental price.

54
00:03:46,926 --> 00:03:49,417
Oh, then may I please rent it, please?

55
00:03:49,529 --> 00:03:52,327
You may not. I am all out.
Though I do have a surprising abundance...

56
00:03:52,432 --> 00:03:54,593
of Lee Carvallo's
Putting Challenge.

57
00:03:54,701 --> 00:03:56,601
Ohh!

58
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:05,269
Milhouse has Bonestorm!

59
00:04:05,378 --> 00:04:10,509
This is great! And all I've done
is enter my name-Thrillhouse!

60
00:04:12,552 --> 00:04:15,248
<i>Say, cool dude,
can I play too?</i>

61
00:04:15,355 --> 00:04:17,789
Uh- Uh, it's only
a one-player game.

62
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:22,793
- Then how come it says "second player score"?
- Mom! Bart's swearing!

63
00:04:22,895 --> 00:04:24,385
- Hey! What the hell-
- No, no, no! Out!

64
00:04:24,497 --> 00:04:26,021
- Damn it, I wasn't swearing!
- Out right now!

65
00:04:26,132 --> 00:04:28,396
Out!

66
00:04:31,137 --> 00:04:35,506
Hmm. Maybe if I stand
next to the games looking sad...

67
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:38,406
someone will feel sorry for me
and buy me one.

68
00:04:50,723 --> 00:04:53,123
Gavin, don't you
already have this game?

69
00:04:53,226 --> 00:04:55,194
No, Mom, you idiot!

70
00:04:55,295 --> 00:05:00,995
- I have Bloodstorm and Bonesquad and Bloodstorm II, stupid!
- Oh, I'm sorry, honey.

71
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:04,661
- We'll take a Bonestorm.
- Get two! I'm not sharing with Caitlin.

72
00:05:07,507 --> 00:05:11,238
That must be the happiest kid
in the world.

73
00:05:11,344 --> 00:05:14,245
<i>Psst.! Hey, Simpson.
Check this out.</i>

74
00:05:15,682 --> 00:05:17,650
Look what I got!

75
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,718
It's the kind I like.

76
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:21,787
Are you guys shoplifting?

77
00:05:21,888 --> 00:05:24,083
Four-finger discount, dude.

78
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:26,784
Shoplifting is a victimless crime...

79
00:05:26,893 --> 00:05:29,521
like punching someone
in the dark!

80
00:05:29,629 --> 00:05:32,359
Yeah!

81
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:51,779
Go ahead-a, Bart.
Take-a the Bonestorm.

82
00:05:51,884 --> 00:05:55,650
The store, she's so rich
she'll-a never notice.

83
00:05:55,755 --> 00:05:59,384
Duh, it's the company's fault
for making you want it so much.

84
00:05:59,492 --> 00:06:02,518
Don't do it, son.
How's that game gonna help your putting?

85
00:06:02,628 --> 00:06:06,189
Just take it! Take it, take it,
take it, take it, take it! Take it!

86
00:06:23,116 --> 00:06:25,482
I'm outside.
I got away with it.

87
00:06:25,585 --> 00:06:27,553
I'm free!

88
00:06:29,455 --> 00:06:32,151
Sir, would you
open your coat, please?

89
00:06:32,258 --> 00:06:36,319
Uhh, I don't think this is
the kind of coat that opens.

90
00:06:36,429 --> 00:06:39,159
Please step back in the store, sir.

91
00:06:39,265 --> 00:06:44,498
Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk. That boy's parents
must've made some terrible mistakes.

92
00:06:44,604 --> 00:06:46,572
Shut up, Mom!

93
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:54,037
Ho-ho-ho!
Here you go, little fella.

94
00:06:54,147 --> 00:06:58,550
- No, no. None for him.
- Oh, I see.

95
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:22,439
Hi, I'm Troy McClure. You might remember me
from such public service videos as...

96
00:07:22,542 --> 00:07:24,806
<i>Designated Drivers:
The Lifesaving Nerds...</i>

97
00:07:24,911 --> 00:07:28,108
<i>and Phony Tornado Alarms
Reduce Readiness.</i>

98
00:07:28,214 --> 00:07:32,583
I'm here today to give you the skinny on
shoplifting, thereby completing my plea bargain...

99
00:07:32,685 --> 00:07:35,119
with the good people at
Foot Locker of Beverly Hills.

100
00:07:35,221 --> 00:07:38,281
Shoplifting began here
in ancient Phoenicia.

101
00:07:38,391 --> 00:07:40,757
Thieves would literally
lift the corner of a shop...

102
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:44,159
in order to snatch the sweet,
sweet olives within.

103
00:07:44,263 --> 00:07:46,857
Oh, Sheheqazaramesh,
will you ever learn?

104
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:51,494
- Flash forward to ancient Babylonia.
- All right, show's over.

105
00:07:51,604 --> 00:07:55,062
- Uh, excuse me-
- You think you're pretty smart, don't you?

106
00:07:55,174 --> 00:07:57,404
- No.
- Don't smart off to me, smart guy.

107
00:07:57,510 --> 00:08:00,138
I-I-I could pay for the game.
I-I'll pay for it!

108
00:08:00,246 --> 00:08:04,580
You know, that kind of mush might fly
at Lamps Plus, but don't peddle it here.

109
00:08:04,684 --> 00:08:06,811
If I wanted smoke
blown up my ass...

110
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:09,387
I'd be at home with a pack of cigarettes
and a short length of hose.

111
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:13,892
That's it, Mr. Comedian. I'm calling your parents.

112
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:18,820
Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Simpson?

113
00:08:18,931 --> 00:08:23,095
This is Detective Don Brodka
from Try-N-Save security.

114
00:08:23,202 --> 00:08:28,105
That's right, Don Brodka.
Your son, Bart, has been caught shoplifting.

115
00:08:28,207 --> 00:08:30,801
Uh-huh. Yeah,
it's a shame, I know...

116
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:34,903
but, well, try and have
a merry Christmas.

117
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:36,948
They weren't home.
Uh-huh.

118
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:40,018
But I left a message on their
answering machine. That's right.

119
00:08:40,119 --> 00:08:43,179
Um, okay. I've really, really,
really learned my lesson.

120
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:46,019
- Can I please go now?
- Yeah, get out of my sight.

121
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:48,093
<i>Hey, kid.</i>

122
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:51,960
One more thing:
If you ever set foot in this store again...

123
00:08:52,064 --> 00:08:55,693
<i>you'll be spending Christmas
in juvenile hall, capisce?</i>

124
00:08:57,570 --> 00:09:00,664
- Well, do you understand?
- Everything except "capeesh. "

125
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:10,214
Lousy, stinking piece of crap.

126
00:09:10,316 --> 00:09:13,649
Gotta change that answering machine tape!
Oh, God, I gotta change that tape!

127
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:18,379
Gotta change Maggie!
Dear God, we gotta change Maggie!

128
00:09:25,164 --> 00:09:30,067
- Hmm. We didn't have a message
when we left. How very odd.

129
00:09:30,169 --> 00:09:34,128
Hello, Muddah. Hello, Faddah

130
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,266
Here I am at Camp Granada

131
00:09:37,376 --> 00:09:40,937
Marge, is Lisa at Camp Granada?

132
00:09:41,047 --> 00:09:44,448
Now to put this tape...

133
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:47,110
where no one
will ever listen to it.

134
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:52,350
Homer, didn't you get any milk?
All I see is eggnog.

135
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:56,554
'Tis the season, Marge!
We only get 30 sweet, noggy days.

136
00:09:56,662 --> 00:09:59,631
Then the government takes it away again.

137
00:09:59,732 --> 00:10:01,962
I think I'm having chest pains.

138
00:10:02,068 --> 00:10:06,368
Bart, get your suit on.

139
00:10:06,472 --> 00:10:09,305
- What for?
- We're getting our Christmas picture taken.

140
00:10:09,408 --> 00:10:13,868
Ah, you lucked out, Marge, my man,
'cause I'm in a smilin' mood today.

141
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:18,974
Well, good! So get ready,
and before you know it we'll be at the Try-N-Save.

142
00:10:19,085 --> 00:10:22,054
<i>Try-N-Save?</i>

143
00:10:22,154 --> 00:10:24,486
Ah, my teapots are ready.

144
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:29,823
<i>If you ever set foot in this store again,
you'll be spending Christmas in juvenile hall-</i>

145
00:10:29,929 --> 00:10:33,888
<i>juvenile hall-juvenile hall.</i>

146
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,868
<i>Stand behind the yellow line.!
You will now receive your Christmas presents...</i>

147
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:41,269
donated by the Port Authority
Lost and Found Office.

148
00:10:41,374 --> 00:10:43,672
Pass your chit to Santa
to receive your gift.

149
00:10:43,776 --> 00:10:47,075
If you do not have a chit,
you will not receive a gift.

150
00:10:47,179 --> 00:10:51,411
Wow!
The March 8 newspaper!

151
00:10:51,517 --> 00:10:55,078
Cool!
A book of carpet samples!

152
00:10:55,187 --> 00:10:57,155
Come on, new bike!

153
00:10:59,358 --> 00:11:01,792
Ohh. A soiled wig.

154
00:11:01,894 --> 00:11:03,862
Merry Christmas and a happy New Year.

155
00:11:05,731 --> 00:11:08,564
<i>Bart, what's taking so long?</i>

156
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:11,796
If you're having that problem with your zipper,
I can send your father up.

157
00:11:11,904 --> 00:11:15,032
Oh, no, I'm not.

158
00:11:15,141 --> 00:11:20,738
What's the matter with your face?
Is that a fake nose? Are you wearing chin putty?

159
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:24,509
I don't have to listen
to these wild allegations!

160
00:11:27,486 --> 00:11:29,716
Please, Bart, no more pranks.

161
00:11:29,822 --> 00:11:34,691
It would mean so much to me
if we could have just one nice family photo.

162
00:11:39,298 --> 00:11:42,324
Hey! I don't remember saying that.

163
00:11:42,435 --> 00:11:46,064
Uh-oh. Almost forgot
to lock the doors.

164
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:54,275
I hope you're going to
the Valley Vista Try-N-Save, kid...

165
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,746
'cause you don't want
to come to my store.

166
00:11:56,849 --> 00:11:58,817
Catfish?

167
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:08,186
So, we're just gonna do this photo
and get out, right? Bada bing, bada boom.

168
00:12:08,294 --> 00:12:10,694
I want to look at the pets,
and write things on the typewriters...

169
00:12:10,796 --> 00:12:13,128
- and see if the new dictionaries are in.
- Okay.

170
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:15,462
I want to price some flip-flops,
and smell the new tires...

171
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:18,366
and consult the pharmacist
for some free medical advice!

172
00:12:18,471 --> 00:12:21,668
Sure! We're gonna have a great day!
Bada bing, bada boom!

173
00:12:21,774 --> 00:12:25,471
Right, Bart? Bart?
What's wrong, honey?

174
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:29,810
Uh-oh! Somebody's got
tired little legs.

175
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:31,542
- Hm!
- Uhh!

176
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:38,780
Hmm. I wonder where
the flip-flops are?

177
00:12:38,891 --> 00:12:43,089
Menswear? Maybe it's Sporting Goods.
Wait, no, Sleepwear.

178
00:12:43,195 --> 00:12:46,426
Oh, probably Better Living.

179
00:12:49,168 --> 00:12:53,468
Oh, Homie. Look at that watch.
I've always wanted a watch like that.

180
00:12:53,572 --> 00:12:58,373
- Well, maybe someone will
give you one for Christmas.

181
00:12:58,477 --> 00:13:02,004
Now she'll really be surprised
when she opens that ironing board cover.

182
00:13:07,853 --> 00:13:09,684
<i>Must've been a pretty slow century.</i>

183
00:13:12,691 --> 00:13:15,353
The store detective!

184
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:19,227
- Hey, Ansel Adams, let's go! Take the photo!
- Oh, wait, wait!

185
00:13:19,331 --> 00:13:22,767
I don't want Maggie's face hidden
behind that pacifier.

186
00:13:24,937 --> 00:13:27,337
Don't worry, Mama.
I can put a smile on baby's face.

187
00:13:27,439 --> 00:13:32,240
Okay, sugar plum.
It's time to meet Mr. Funny Voice.

188
00:13:32,344 --> 00:13:35,575
Hello, I'll-
Oh, it's just air.

189
00:13:37,082 --> 00:13:39,175
Oh, come on! Hurry up!

190
00:13:39,285 --> 00:13:41,185
<i>Okay, people. One, two, three.</i>

191
00:13:41,287 --> 00:13:44,848
<i>I thought I told you:</i>

192
00:13:44,957 --> 00:13:48,791
- no returns for busted merchandise.
- What are you doing to my son?

193
00:13:48,894 --> 00:13:53,661
I'm afraid your son broke the 11 th Commandment:
Thou shalt not steal.

194
00:13:53,766 --> 00:13:57,702
That's crazy! Bart's not a shoplifter.
He's just a little boy.

195
00:13:57,803 --> 00:14:01,796
Oh, sure.
Now he's just a little boy stealing little toys.

196
00:14:01,907 --> 00:14:04,205
But someday he'll be
a grown man...

197
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:07,279
stealing stadiums and-
and quarries.

198
00:14:07,379 --> 00:14:11,645
My son may not be perfect,
but I know in my heart he's not a shoplifter.

199
00:14:13,719 --> 00:14:17,678
Fine, play the tape.
Then everyone can see you've got the wrong boy.

200
00:14:19,124 --> 00:14:22,321
Wait! Mom, I don't
want you to see this.

201
00:14:22,428 --> 00:14:25,056
I did it.

202
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:31,864
<i>Bart, I wouldn't have expected this even from you.</i>

203
00:14:31,971 --> 00:14:33,939
My son's a thief.

204
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:36,007
Oh, Bart.

205
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:44,242
Stealing! How could you?

206
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:47,945
Haven't you learned anything from that guy
who gives those sermons at church?

207
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:52,387
Captain What's-his-name?
We live in a society of laws!

208
00:14:52,491 --> 00:14:55,517
<i>Why do you think I took you to all those
Police Academy movies?</i>

209
00:14:55,628 --> 00:15:00,065
For fun? Well, I didn't hear
anybody laughing! Did you?

210
00:15:00,165 --> 00:15:02,429
Except at that guy
who made sound effects.

211
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:06,997
Honk, honk!

212
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:14,668
Where was I? Oh, yeah.
Stay out of my booze!

213
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:18,079
Mom, I'm really sorry.

214
00:15:18,183 --> 00:15:21,550
- I know you are.
- Is there anything I can do?

215
00:15:21,654 --> 00:15:23,986
I don't know.

216
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:27,252
- Why don't you go to bed?
- Okay.

217
00:15:37,336 --> 00:15:41,204
Man, I thought Mom was gonna scream me stupid.
She didn't even raise her voice.

218
00:15:41,307 --> 00:15:45,573
I admit I haven't known Mom as long as you have,
but I know when she's really upset.

219
00:15:45,678 --> 00:15:48,647
Her heart won't just wipe clean
like this bathroom countertop.

220
00:15:48,747 --> 00:15:53,150
It absorbs everything that touches it
like this bathroom rug.

221
00:15:53,252 --> 00:15:55,948
<i>Really?
You think this might be...</i>

222
00:15:56,055 --> 00:15:59,286
- one of those forever-type things?
- I don't know.

223
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:07,190
<i>Lisa's on the sleepy train to rest her weary head</i>

224
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:12,601
<i>Her ticket is a candy cane
made out of gingerbread</i>

225
00:16:12,705 --> 00:16:16,471
<i>- Good night, Mom.
- Good night, sweetheart.</i>

226
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:22,341
<i>Oh, great.
The Tuck-in Express is right on time.</i>

227
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:26,751
Good night.

228
00:16:30,356 --> 00:16:33,985
I've figured out the boy's punishment.
First, he's grounded.

229
00:16:34,093 --> 00:16:36,220
No leaving the house,
not even for school.

230
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:39,957
Second, no eggnog.
In fact, no nog period.

231
00:16:40,065 --> 00:16:43,228
And third, absolutely no stealing
for three months.

232
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:46,463
I always thought I understood
my special little guy.

233
00:16:46,572 --> 00:16:50,508
But somewhere along the road,
his hand slipped away from mine.

234
00:16:50,609 --> 00:16:54,045
Eh, what are you gonna do?

235
00:16:54,146 --> 00:16:58,776
He's not my little baby anymore.

236
00:16:58,884 --> 00:17:01,785
Maybe I mother him too much.

237
00:17:13,732 --> 00:17:16,530
Hey, Mom,
you didn't wake me up.

238
00:17:16,635 --> 00:17:19,035
Here's your hot chocolate.

239
00:17:19,138 --> 00:17:20,969
You didn't put my marshmallow in.

240
00:17:21,073 --> 00:17:23,769
I think you're old enough
to do it yourself now.

241
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:26,606
Okay. I can handle that.

242
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:36,879
Hey, give me a slice!

243
00:17:38,857 --> 00:17:43,157
Milhouse, do you ever worry
that your mom might stop loving you?

244
00:17:43,262 --> 00:17:46,163
What? I'm more worried
about piranhas.

245
00:17:46,265 --> 00:17:49,632
Did you see that movie where they sent
a nuclear submarine to fight the piranhas...

246
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:52,932
and one of them swims right down
the periscope and bites the guy in the eye...

247
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:55,006
and he goes,
"Aah! Aah! Aah!"

248
00:17:55,107 --> 00:17:57,337
and that old lady
told him it would happen?

249
00:17:57,443 --> 00:18:01,539
Yeah, that was pretty good.
Hey, how come you're not playing Bonestorm?

250
00:18:01,647 --> 00:18:05,413
Ahh, it got boring.
I'm really into this cup and ball now.

251
00:18:05,517 --> 00:18:07,576
Whoa! Wow!

252
00:18:07,686 --> 00:18:12,953
- Man, you never know which way this crazy ball's gonna go!
- Yeah, right.

253
00:18:13,058 --> 00:18:16,186
You're just trying to trick me, 'cause you
don't want me playing with your video game.

254
00:18:16,295 --> 00:18:18,422
Here, go ahead.

255
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:20,828
- No. Let me try the cup and ball.
- Get your own!

256
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:24,096
- Come on! Don't be a cup-and-ball hog!
- Hey, give it! That's mine!

257
00:18:24,203 --> 00:18:26,728
- Give me the cup and ball, you cup-and-ball hog!
- Give it, give it!

258
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:30,297
- Come on, you little oink-oink!
- Mom! Bart's smoking!

259
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:34,038
- All right! Out, out, out! Go, go, go!
- But Milhouse-What are you-

260
00:18:34,146 --> 00:18:36,273
- Okay, okay, okay. I won't bug Milhouse.
- Out!

261
00:18:36,381 --> 00:18:41,614
But, well, Mrs. Van Houten,
this is gonna sound kinda dumb...

262
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:46,714
but can I hang out with you
while you do mom stuff?

263
00:18:52,498 --> 00:18:55,558
- Who are Dan and Sherry Adler?
- Just friends of ours.

264
00:18:55,667 --> 00:18:58,067
Oh. And who is Warren Burke?

265
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:01,833
He used to tune our piano
before we got rid of it.

266
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:03,965
He grew up in Mechanicsburg.

267
00:19:04,076 --> 00:19:06,271
- Oh, really?
- Hmm.

268
00:19:06,378 --> 00:19:08,346
Tell me I'm good.

269
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:15,420
Oh, hey, that's Mom!
She's happy again!

270
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:20,220
You guys made
a snowman family?

271
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:25,126
Check it out, boy.
It's like looking into a living snow mirror.

272
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:28,358
- Why didn't you wait for me?
- I didn't think you'd mind.

273
00:19:28,467 --> 00:19:31,334
I figured you were getting
a little too old for this.

274
00:19:31,436 --> 00:19:35,372
But you can still make one.
There's some snow left under the car.

275
00:19:51,723 --> 00:19:53,691
Stupid family.

276
00:19:53,792 --> 00:19:57,159
Hey, Simpson.
Look what I swiped from Try-N-Save.

277
00:19:57,262 --> 00:20:01,358
- It's a replacement tire for a wheelbarrow.
- Huh?

278
00:20:01,466 --> 00:20:04,993
<i>I knew you'd like it.</i>

279
00:20:07,105 --> 00:20:09,665
Everybody thinks
I'm the black sheep.

280
00:20:09,775 --> 00:20:12,505
Well, I'll show 'em
what a black sheep can do!

281
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:21,579
Mom, this fake snow
is making me dizzy.

282
00:20:21,687 --> 00:20:25,589
We're almost finished.
There's just a little bit of green left.

283
00:20:27,859 --> 00:20:31,090
There you are. You can
help me spray the cookies.

284
00:20:31,196 --> 00:20:35,792
- Are you hiding something? What do you have under your jacket?
- Nothing!

285
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:37,766
Oh, Bart, not again!
Give it to me.

286
00:20:37,869 --> 00:20:39,734
I told you.
I don't have anything.

287
00:20:39,838 --> 00:20:45,504
You can't hide from me in this house, Bart.
I spend 23 hours a day here!

288
00:20:45,611 --> 00:20:49,570
Get him, Ma.

289
00:20:49,681 --> 00:20:53,481
There's no place left to run, Bart.
Hand it over.

290
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:59,354
Oh, Bart.
I can't believe you did this.

291
00:21:00,993 --> 00:21:02,984
I wanted to surprise you
for Christmas.

292
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:07,395
Oh, sweetie, this is the best present
a mother could get.

293
00:21:10,235 --> 00:21:12,760
I love you so much!

294
00:21:12,871 --> 00:21:15,533
My little, bitty Barty!

295
00:21:15,641 --> 00:21:17,609

00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:25,982
Since I got my present early,
I think you should get yours early too.

297
00:21:26,084 --> 00:21:29,781
Bart get a present early? Then I should
get a present early. I want a present!

298
00:21:29,888 --> 00:21:35,190
- Lisa, you have to wait.
- Great. This is the worst Christmas ever.

299
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:38,354
Now, I know you love video games,
and I asked the clerk...

300
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:41,432
- "Which is the one every boy wants?"
- You got me-

301
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:48,371
Oh-h-h! Oh, yeah!

302
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:52,903
Thanks, Mom.

303
00:22:02,788 --> 00:22:05,450

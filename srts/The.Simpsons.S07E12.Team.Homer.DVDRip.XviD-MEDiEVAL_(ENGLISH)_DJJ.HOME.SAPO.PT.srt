<i>The Simpsons</i>

2
00:00:15,415 --> 00:00:17,508
D'oh!

3
00:00:37,203 --> 00:00:40,297
<i>Oh, my God!
The Mad magazine special edition.</i>

4
00:00:40,407 --> 00:00:43,103
They only put out 17 of these a year!

5
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:48,977
Boy, they're really sockin' it to that Spiro Agnew
guy again. He must work there or something.

6
00:00:49,082 --> 00:00:51,209
<i>- Let's do the fold-in.
- Okay.</i>

7
00:00:51,317 --> 00:00:54,377
"What higher power
do TV evangelists worship?"

8
00:00:54,487 --> 00:00:56,580
- I'll say God.
- I'll sayJesus.

9
00:00:56,689 --> 00:01:00,921
<i>- "The almighty dollar"?
- You fold it, you bought it.</i>

10
00:01:01,027 --> 00:01:03,962
Whoo! "Snappy answers
to stupid questions. "

11
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:07,158
I'm great at these. Ask me
if something smells funny in here, boy.

12
00:01:07,267 --> 00:01:11,465
- Does something smell funny in here?
- I don't think so, stupid.

13
00:01:13,506 --> 00:01:17,772
- Homie, you want pork chops?
- No, I want roast beef, you clod!

14
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:23,574
Look at this. Special insert:
"Iron-on madness.

15
00:01:23,683 --> 00:01:26,675
Ban the bath.
Don't trust anyone over 10.

16
00:01:26,786 --> 00:01:29,050
Sock it to me!"

17
00:01:29,155 --> 00:01:34,525
Those magazines
create a dangerous amount of laughter.

18
00:01:34,627 --> 00:01:38,188
"The 'all-ighty ollar"'?

19
00:01:38,298 --> 00:01:40,391
I get it.

20
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:44,266
Say, business stinks tonight.
Where's Barney, Lenny and Carl?

21
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:48,898
They never come around anymore now
that they got their mistresses.

22
00:01:49,008 --> 00:01:50,942
Might as well close the dump.

23
00:01:51,044 --> 00:01:53,410
- I am gonna drink you under the table.
- No.

24
00:01:53,513 --> 00:01:57,074
I am going to drink you under the-

25
00:01:57,183 --> 00:02:00,311
Well, you're closin'. It's gettin' late.

26
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:03,150
My kids are probably wondering
where their daddy is.

27
00:02:03,256 --> 00:02:06,054
There's gotta be some other place
we can go. Think, Moe! Think!

28
00:02:08,695 --> 00:02:12,153
Sorry. It's league night.
I couldn't give a lane to my own mother.

29
00:02:12,265 --> 00:02:14,165
I have no son.

30
00:02:16,269 --> 00:02:19,898
Man, you go through life,
you try to be nice to people...

31
00:02:20,006 --> 00:02:23,533
you struggle to resist the urge
to punch 'em in the face, and for what?

32
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:28,103
For some pimply little puke that treats ya
like dirt unless you're on a team.

33
00:02:28,214 --> 00:02:31,980
Well, I'm better than dirt.
Well, most kinds of dirt.

34
00:02:32,085 --> 00:02:35,145
I mean, not that fancy, store-bought dirt.
That stuff's loaded with nutrients.

35
00:02:35,255 --> 00:02:37,416
I can't compete with that stuff.

36
00:02:37,524 --> 00:02:42,325
That I cannot bowl wreaks havoc with
my self-esteem as well, but who am I to complain?

37
00:02:42,428 --> 00:02:46,865
Well, I'm tired of being a wannabe
league bowler. I wanna be a league bowler!

38
00:02:46,966 --> 00:02:50,197
Hey, we can be a team.

39
00:02:50,303 --> 00:02:54,399
<i>Excuse me, but my team
is ready to bowl.</i>

40
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:57,237
- You're short one person.
- Uh...

41
00:02:57,343 --> 00:03:00,107
that long-haired freak's
bowled with us for years.

42
00:03:00,213 --> 00:03:04,741
I don't care if it takes me all night.
I'm gonna get me that lobster harmonica.

43
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:07,217
<i>Come on, lobstie. Whoo.</i>

44
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:12,849
- Oh, okay. Then I just need your $500 registration fee.
- $500!

45
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:16,451
Oh, no problem. Would you take
an out-of-state, two-party, bad check?

46
00:03:16,563 --> 00:03:19,726
No, I will not
pay you $500 for sex.

47
00:03:19,832 --> 00:03:25,065
Aw, come on, Marge. You're getting something
in return, and I'm getting a bowling team.

48
00:03:25,171 --> 00:03:28,038
- It's win-win.
- It's sick...

49
00:03:28,141 --> 00:03:30,632
and I don't have that kind
of money to spend on sex.

50
00:03:30,743 --> 00:03:34,679
Maybe you could get someone with money
to sponsor your team, like Mr. Burns.

51
00:03:34,781 --> 00:03:36,942
Burns never gives money to anybody.

52
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:40,076
- Just last week, I asked him for $1,500.
- For what?

53
00:03:40,186 --> 00:03:42,086
Oh, I gotta
get the third degree from you too?

54
00:03:42,188 --> 00:03:46,124
- Tonight's homework assignment is-
- Oh, man, is it hot in here.

55
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:49,161
I'd better take off my sweater.

56
00:03:49,262 --> 00:03:52,959
<i>"Down with"-
"homework"?</i>

57
00:03:55,935 --> 00:03:58,597
- Don't look at it, children.
- His shirt makes a good point.

58
00:03:58,705 --> 00:04:01,299
I'm with the shirt!
Homework rots!

59
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:04,308
Down with homework!
Down with homework!

60
00:04:06,779 --> 00:04:10,271
Mmm.

61
00:04:10,383 --> 00:04:14,046
As I was saying, my yearly evaluation
couldn't have come at a better time.

62
00:04:14,153 --> 00:04:17,350
Well, Seymour, I must say,
for once, I am impressed.

63
00:04:17,457 --> 00:04:21,291
In fact, I am going
to give this school a perfect 10.

64
00:04:21,394 --> 00:04:24,488
I'll just write the zero first.

65
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:28,192
Now a vertical line
to indicate the one.

66
00:04:28,301 --> 00:04:30,861
Down with homework!

67
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:36,203
Skinner, why are there children
walking on my head?

68
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:42,578
<i>So, we meet again,
Mad magazine.</i>

69
00:04:42,682 --> 00:04:45,412
<i>- How do you know it's from Mad?
- The year was 1968.</i>

70
00:04:45,518 --> 00:04:48,783
We were on recon
in a steaming Mekong delta.

71
00:04:48,888 --> 00:04:52,051
An overheated private removed
his flak jacket, revealing a T-shirt...

72
00:04:52,158 --> 00:04:55,787
<i>with an iron-on sporting
the Mad slogan "up with miniskirts. "</i>

73
00:04:55,895 --> 00:04:58,796
Well, we all had a good laugh,
even though I didn't quite understand it.

74
00:04:58,898 --> 00:05:03,335
But our momentary lapse of concentration
allowed Charlie to get the drop on us.

75
00:05:03,436 --> 00:05:06,030
I spent the next three years
in a P.O.W. camp...

76
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:09,700
forced to subsist on a thin stew
made of fish, vegetables...

77
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:13,609
prawns, coconut milk
and four kinds of rice.

78
00:05:13,713 --> 00:05:16,113
I came close to madness
trying to find it here in the States...

79
00:05:16,215 --> 00:05:18,513
but they just can't
get the spices right.

80
00:05:18,618 --> 00:05:21,883
- Uh, my punishment?
- Hmm? Oh, I'm gonna have to think about that.

81
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:24,718
Meanwhile, wear this home.

82
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:30,293
No-o-o.
I need some more ether.

83
00:05:30,396 --> 00:05:34,059
I can still feel
the movement of the emery board.

84
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:37,762
- We're fresh out, sir. I'll get some more.
- Leave the rag.

85
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:40,168
Mmm.

86
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:45,838
Uh, excuse me, Mr. Burns.

87
00:05:45,945 --> 00:05:49,642
Pop 'n' Fresh,
you glutinous little dough boy!

88
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:52,877
There's something
I've wanted to do to you for years.

89
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:58,885
Ow.

90
00:05:58,991 --> 00:06:01,960
Mr. Burns,
I was wondering if you'd like...

91
00:06:02,061 --> 00:06:05,360
to sponsor my bowling team
for $500.

92
00:06:05,465 --> 00:06:07,490
Why, certainly, Pop 'n' Fresh.

93
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,728
I owe my robust physique to your tubes
of triple-bleached goo.

94
00:06:10,837 --> 00:06:16,469
Whoo-hoo! Hey, everybody, if you wanna
ask Burns for a favor, now's the time!

95
00:06:16,576 --> 00:06:19,409
He's doped up
or dyin' or somethin'!

96
00:06:19,512 --> 00:06:23,073
Uh, excuse me.
I'd like to request $17...

97
00:06:23,182 --> 00:06:26,083
for a push broom rebristling.

98
00:06:26,185 --> 00:06:31,122
Why, it's that delightful TV leprechaun!
I'm going to get your Lucky Charms.

99
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:34,557
<i>Oh, no. My brains.</i>

100
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:54,369
Hey, nice, quote,
uniforms, end quote.

101
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:58,041
This just in. A new addition
to our worst-dressed list: those guys!

102
00:07:01,354 --> 00:07:04,517
Oh, forget this.
I am far too fragile...

103
00:07:04,624 --> 00:07:07,320
to withstand an evening
of barbs like that.

104
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:11,056
Oh, come on. If we quit now, we'll never
know how badly they're gonna beat us.

105
00:07:11,164 --> 00:07:14,190
Yeah, you're right. That's the kind
of thing that would haunt ya.

106
00:07:16,068 --> 00:07:18,002
<i>- Hey!
- Sí.</i>

107
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:20,971
<i>: Buenas noches, senoritas.!</i>

108
00:07:21,073 --> 00:07:23,439
What did he say? What did he say?
Was that about me?

109
00:07:24,577 --> 00:07:26,977
Okay, Otto. Pressure's on.

110
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:30,879
Don't choke. Don't choke.
Don't choke. Don't... choke.

111
00:07:32,385 --> 00:07:34,546
Oh, man!
I knew I was gonna choke.

112
00:07:34,654 --> 00:07:37,817
<i>- That's a funny-lookin' strike.
- Come on, guys.</i>

113
00:07:37,924 --> 00:07:40,449
Let's be the team
that supports each other.

114
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,256
You can do it, Otto!
You can do it, Otto!

115
00:07:43,362 --> 00:07:45,990
Help each other out!
That'll be our motto!

116
00:07:46,098 --> 00:07:48,760
You can do it, Otto!
You can do it, Otto!

117
00:07:48,868 --> 00:07:51,166
Make this spare,
I give you free gelato!

118
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:53,830
Then back to my place,
where I will get you blotto!

119
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:58,536
<i>- Domo arigato, Mr. Roboto.
- You can do it, Otto! You can do it-</i>

120
00:07:58,644 --> 00:08:01,272
Guys, I made the spare.
We won.

121
00:08:02,381 --> 00:08:05,350
Yes! Yeah! All right!

122
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:11,214
Those beers
are five dollars apiece.

123
00:08:18,965 --> 00:08:20,956
- Let me set the scene for you, Marge.
- All right.

124
00:08:21,067 --> 00:08:24,525
- It's a 7-10 split, the hardest shot in bowling.
- Uh-huh.

125
00:08:24,637 --> 00:08:28,630
It was all up to me,
so I got up all my courage.

126
00:08:28,741 --> 00:08:31,335
Right away,
my lips started to move...

127
00:08:31,444 --> 00:08:34,845
and I came up with a chant
that won the match!

128
00:08:34,947 --> 00:08:40,112
- Who knocked down the pins?
- I don't know. You know, some guy. Otto, I guess.

129
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:44,986
- Good for him.
- Yes, but, Marge, you're missing the point.

130
00:08:45,091 --> 00:08:49,323
The individual doesn't matter.
It was a team effort.

131
00:08:49,428 --> 00:08:53,125
And I was the one who came up
with the whole team idea.

132
00:08:53,232 --> 00:08:57,328
- Me.
- I can't believe Otto picked up a 7-10 split.

133
00:08:57,436 --> 00:08:59,836
- He's phenomenal. Wow.
- But-

134
00:08:59,939 --> 00:09:01,930
Several days ago,
a violent riot erupted...

135
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:04,703
incited by an inflammatory T-shirt slogan.

136
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:08,211
No, no. Now, don't try to remember
what that slogan was.

137
00:09:08,314 --> 00:09:11,613
To ensure that this frenzied dance
of destruction is never repeated...

138
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:16,416
I've decided, starting Monday,
all students will be required to wear uniforms.

139
00:09:16,522 --> 00:09:19,457
Huh? Uniforms?

140
00:09:24,463 --> 00:09:28,229
Say hello to our little genius, Martin,
who looks even smarter...

141
00:09:28,334 --> 00:09:33,829
<i>in this vest and short pant combination
from Mr. Boy of Main Street.</i>

142
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:37,376
<i>Or how about little Lisa Simpson?</i>

143
00:09:37,476 --> 00:09:41,435
<i>She'll have no reason to play the blues
in this snappy ensemble...</i>

144
00:09:41,547 --> 00:09:43,981
<i>topped off with a saucy French beret...</i>

145
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:47,780
<i>that seems to scream "silence. "</i>

146
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:56,019
All right. Pick your size:
extra small or extra large.

147
00:09:56,128 --> 00:09:59,097
We've got both.
No pushing now. I-What?

148
00:09:59,198 --> 00:10:01,894
Oh, I've just been informed
we've run out of extra large.

149
00:10:02,001 --> 00:10:06,131
<i>Go, Moe.! Go, Moe.!
Don't make Homer shout out, "D'oh.!"</i>

150
00:10:06,238 --> 00:10:09,867
Yeah!

151
00:10:16,215 --> 00:10:18,547
<i>Yea!</i>

152
00:10:18,651 --> 00:10:20,642
All right, Snake.
Make us proud.

153
00:10:25,658 --> 00:10:28,855
One, two, three,
four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10.

154
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:30,929
Bye!

155
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:33,191
Ah, we forfeit.

156
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:36,166
<i>We'll take it.</i>

157
00:10:40,406 --> 00:10:43,898
There it is, boys:
the championship trophy.

158
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:45,978
Whoo.
We will never possess it.

159
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:49,013
The Holy Rollers
have won it five years in a row.

160
00:10:49,115 --> 00:10:51,811
<i>They think they're so high and mighty...</i>

161
00:10:51,917 --> 00:10:54,112
just 'cause they never
got caught drivin' without pants.

162
00:10:57,189 --> 00:11:01,785
God boy couldn't get a strike!

163
00:11:03,262 --> 00:11:05,287
It's me. Ned.

164
00:11:08,567 --> 00:11:12,560
Mom, my slingshot doesn't
fit in these pockets...

165
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:14,833
and these shorts leave nothing
to the imagination.

166
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:18,432
- These uniforms suck.
- Bart, where do you pick up words like that?

167
00:11:18,544 --> 00:11:21,809
<i>Yeah, Moe, that team sure did suck
last night. Theyjust plain sucked.</i>

168
00:11:21,914 --> 00:11:25,975
I've seen teams suck before, but they were
the suckiest bunch of sucks that ever sucked.

169
00:11:26,085 --> 00:11:29,919
- Homer, watch your mouth!
- I gotta go. My damn wiener kids are listening.

170
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:32,786
- We are not wieners.
- Then what are you dressed like that for?

171
00:11:32,892 --> 00:11:35,793
- They made us.
- Oh. "They made us. "

172
00:11:35,895 --> 00:11:39,092
That's loser talk. You gotta start acting
more like me and my team...

173
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:41,393
the future league champions
of the world.

174
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,468
Nothing's gonna stop us now.

175
00:11:43,569 --> 00:11:46,936
Stop everything! I don't remember
writing a check for bowling.

176
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:51,442
- Sir, that's a check for your boweling.
- Oh, yes. That's very important.

177
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:53,444
Yes, sir.
Remember that month you didn't do it?

178
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:55,878
Yes, that was unpleasant for all concerned.

179
00:11:55,981 --> 00:11:58,779
Anyway, back to the checks.
Stop everything!

180
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:02,217
- I don't remember writing a check for bowling.
- Hmm.

181
00:12:02,321 --> 00:12:04,881
The memo says,
"To my pal, Pop 'n' Fresh. "

182
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:07,925
Oh, yes.
That greedy, grasping glob of chemicals.

183
00:12:08,027 --> 00:12:10,359
Probably one of your
ether-induced hallucinations, sir.

184
00:12:10,463 --> 00:12:13,557
I'll check the employee files to see
who could pull off such an impersonation.

185
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:20,229
It was either Pops Freshenmeyer...

186
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:22,330
<i>or Homer Simpson.</i>

187
00:12:25,044 --> 00:12:29,640
Simpson, eh? Let's shut down
this bowling scam right now.

188
00:12:34,453 --> 00:12:38,514
<i>Come on, Homer. Come on, Homer.
Pretend this is baseball and hit us a homer.</i>

189
00:12:40,659 --> 00:12:45,790
You rolled it. You rolled it.

190
00:12:45,898 --> 00:12:49,664
By the way, rhyming "Homer"
with "Homer"-

191
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:52,704
Look at them, Smithers,
enjoying their embezzlement.

192
00:12:52,805 --> 00:12:57,037
I have a much uglier word
for it, sir: misappropriation.

193
00:12:57,143 --> 00:13:00,169
<i>Simpson.!</i>

194
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:03,510
<i>Listen here. I want to join your team.</i>

195
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:05,481
- You wanna join my what?
- You wanna what his team?

196
00:13:05,584 --> 00:13:08,144
I've had one
of my unpredictable changes of heart.

197
00:13:08,254 --> 00:13:12,850
Seeing these fine young athletes reveling
in the humiliation of a vanquished foe-

198
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:17,622
I haven't felt this energized
since my last... boweling.

199
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:19,925
Oh, man.
He'll blow our winning streak.

200
00:13:20,032 --> 00:13:23,490
Yeah. Call this
an unfair generalization if you must...

201
00:13:23,602 --> 00:13:26,230
but old people
are no good at everything.

202
00:13:26,338 --> 00:13:28,863
Look, guys,
it's not that simple. He's my boss.

203
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:32,137
I'll tell you what.
I'll give him a shot, and if he stinks...

204
00:13:32,244 --> 00:13:34,337
it'll be easier to tell him no.

205
00:13:37,183 --> 00:13:39,777
Ooh-

206
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:50,387
Welcome aboard!

207
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:52,464
It wasn't any easier.

208
00:13:58,904 --> 00:14:01,031
Ah, these uniforms
are a godsend.

209
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:04,598
Horseplay's down 40%.
Youthful exuberance has been cut in half.

210
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:07,338
High spirits
are at an all-time low.

211
00:14:07,446 --> 00:14:12,145
- They've even begun blinking in unison.
- I love that sound.

212
00:14:12,251 --> 00:14:15,482
Now, children,
while you're having quiet time...

213
00:14:15,588 --> 00:14:19,718
I'm going to make sure
my desk is exactly parallel to the rear wall.

214
00:14:23,729 --> 00:14:27,460
Oh, there's something I used...

215
00:14:27,566 --> 00:14:33,027
to do in this situation,
but can't remember.

216
00:14:33,138 --> 00:14:35,333
Ha- ho?

217
00:14:35,441 --> 00:14:39,241
I can't believe I got
booted off the team for Mr. Businessman.

218
00:14:39,345 --> 00:14:43,441
I bet I'll get a little respect
once I get that Harvard diploma.

219
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:57,655
Look at that. All the way
to the end with only one push.

220
00:14:57,763 --> 00:15:01,130
That's the third game
in a row he cost us, Homer.

221
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:03,633
<i>- Mamma mia.!
- Hoot, mon!</i>

222
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:08,105
- Yee-haw!
- Arr, me mateys. Arr.

223
00:15:08,207 --> 00:15:10,971
Whoo! They begged me
to join their team- begged me.

224
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:16,575
Well, we certainly
got walloped tonight, eh, fellas?

225
00:15:16,682 --> 00:15:19,617
Well-

226
00:15:19,718 --> 00:15:23,552
Uh, Mr. Burns, next week
is the big championship game.

227
00:15:23,656 --> 00:15:26,386
Ah, yes,
that silly championship.

228
00:15:26,492 --> 00:15:29,427
The only ship worth a damn
is friendship.

229
00:15:29,528 --> 00:15:33,624
Look. Here comes the "friend ship"
sailing your way.

230
00:15:33,732 --> 00:15:36,428
Ooh, here.
Let me get that, friend.

231
00:15:36,535 --> 00:15:41,529
Oops. Lost a nail.
Well, that's leprosy for you.

232
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:55,921
You're it.

233
00:15:56,021 --> 00:15:58,683
- Now you are the one who is it.
- Understood.

234
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:02,488
Well, I've gotta hand it to you, Seymour.
These drab student coverings...

235
00:16:02,594 --> 00:16:05,529
have created the perfect
distraction-free environment...

236
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:08,862
thus preparing the children for
permanent positions in tomorrow's mills...

237
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:11,095
and processing facilities.

238
00:16:11,203 --> 00:16:13,865
Best of all, with less
than a minute to go before I leave...

239
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:17,272
<i>absolutely nothing has gone wrong.</i>

240
00:16:19,244 --> 00:16:23,977
Well, it is starting to rain,
but I could hardly be blamed for that, can I?

241
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:29,287
Yes. Very good.

242
00:16:37,396 --> 00:16:40,194
Wow!
Look at all the colors, man!

243
00:16:40,299 --> 00:16:43,359
Red, green, yellow, orange!
I remember all of these!

244
00:16:43,469 --> 00:16:46,233
I'm freaking out!

245
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:49,569
Hey, something's
comin' back to me!

246
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:53,441
<i>- Down with homework!
- And down with uniforms.!</i>

247
00:16:53,545 --> 00:16:55,638
Yea!

248
00:16:57,883 --> 00:16:59,350
Ow, ow, ow, ow! Skinner...

249
00:16:59,451 --> 00:17:01,412
why aren't these uniforms colorfast?

250
00:17:07,126 --> 00:17:10,061
I don't understand it. I got them
at the same place I buy Mother's dresses, and-

251
00:17:10,162 --> 00:17:14,223
- Good Lord! Mother's in the park!
- This I've gotta see.

252
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:18,167
Oh, Marge, we were so close
to winning the championship.

253
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:20,170
Now, thanks to Burns,
it's never gonna happen.

254
00:17:20,272 --> 00:17:24,208
And I spent so much time
building that trophy case.

255
00:17:27,112 --> 00:17:31,640
Homer, maybe Mr. Burns will bowl
a great game, and you will win your championship.

256
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:35,914
So you're saying we're
definitely gonna win? Whoo-hoo!

257
00:17:36,021 --> 00:17:40,253
<i>I won't need this anymore.</i>

258
00:17:44,329 --> 00:17:47,230
<i>Marge, someone broke the toilet.</i>

259
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:58,075
Don't worry about nothin', Homer.
I have a feeling...

260
00:17:58,177 --> 00:18:02,580
that Mr. Burns is gonna have
a little accident that might keep him...

261
00:18:02,681 --> 00:18:06,139
from bowlin' with us
tonight, heh, heh, heh.

262
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:12,549
Smithers, I'm afraid
I won't be able to play tonight.

263
00:18:12,658 --> 00:18:15,058
My old gimpy knee
has gone akimbo again.

264
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:18,152
- Take that!
- Ooh!

265
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:23,132
Smithers, that precision assault popped it
back into place. Thank you, masked stranger!

266
00:18:23,235 --> 00:18:25,965
D'oh! He's gonna ruin everything!
All right. That's it, Homer.

267
00:18:26,071 --> 00:18:28,062
Either Burns goes,
or Moe goes.

268
00:18:28,173 --> 00:18:30,733
Yes, I am afraid that I am going
to have to make a similar threat...

269
00:18:30,843 --> 00:18:32,936
with my name in place
of Moe's name.

270
00:18:33,045 --> 00:18:35,843
So, who's ready to
kick some Christian keister?

271
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:39,509
Oh, uh, Mr. Burns,
as team captain...

272
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:41,984
it's my duty to inform you that-

273
00:18:42,087 --> 00:18:45,818
Ooh, I almost forgot!
I brought you all a little something.

274
00:18:47,493 --> 00:18:50,656
Aww, would you look at that?
The "Pin Pals. "

275
00:18:50,762 --> 00:18:55,461
At last, I finally have a garment
fine enough to be married in.

276
00:18:55,567 --> 00:19:00,402
I've always been wealthy, but this
is the first time I ever felt... rich.

277
00:19:00,506 --> 00:19:04,442
- Aww.
- Now, Homer, you were about to say something to me.

278
00:19:04,543 --> 00:19:07,535
- You're off the team.
- What?

279
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:12,049
He's just ribbin' ya, Monty.

280
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:14,676
Yes.

281
00:19:14,786 --> 00:19:16,811
- Had you going there.
- Guys.

282
00:19:21,927 --> 00:19:25,021
Hey, hey, hey!

283
00:19:34,373 --> 00:19:38,469
<i>- Hallelujah.
- Hallelujah.!</i>

284
00:19:38,577 --> 00:19:41,569
Aww.

285
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:47,449
- Nice one, Homer.
- Thanks.

286
00:19:49,421 --> 00:19:53,221
Okay. The Holy Rollers are ahead by one pin...

287
00:19:53,325 --> 00:19:56,624
and we only
have one bowler left: Mr. Burns.

288
00:19:56,728 --> 00:19:59,356
Hmm?

289
00:20:09,575 --> 00:20:13,238
Well, next time, a few steps more
toward center, don't you think?

290
00:20:13,345 --> 00:20:15,313
Good-bye, trophy.

291
00:20:25,123 --> 00:20:28,422
Ooh. Whatever
I got ahold of is big.

292
00:20:44,109 --> 00:20:45,770
- Yes!
- Excellent.

293
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:49,138
Yes!

294
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:53,708
Whoo-hoo! We won! We won!

295
00:21:00,025 --> 00:21:02,721
- You mean, I won.
- But we were a team, sir.

296
00:21:02,828 --> 00:21:05,695
Oh, I'm afraid I've had one
of my trademark changes of heart.

297
00:21:05,797 --> 00:21:07,765
You see,
teamwork will only take you so far.

298
00:21:07,866 --> 00:21:12,132
Then the truly evolved person
makes that extra grab for personal glory.

299
00:21:12,237 --> 00:21:16,401
Now I must discard my teammates, much
like the boxer must shed roll after roll...

300
00:21:16,508 --> 00:21:19,807
of sweaty, useless, disgusting flab
before he can win the title.

301
00:21:19,911 --> 00:21:23,506
- Ta.
- I guess some people never change.

302
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:27,517
Or they quickly change
and then quickly change back.

303
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:30,884
You know what?
We don't need him or his trophy.

304
00:21:30,989 --> 00:21:35,722
- We got each other, huh?
- Yeah, yeah. That's right, Moe. Aww.

305
00:21:35,827 --> 00:21:39,263
<i>- Go, Homer, you're our man!
If you can't do it, nobody can!</i>

306
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:47,031
Ooh!

307
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:52,008
No! Oh, God!

308
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:56,376
- Well, I guess no one can.
- Run, before they're through feeding!

309
00:21:56,481 --> 00:22:00,440
<i>No.! Oh, God.!</i>

310
00:22:00,552 --> 00:22:02,486
<i>No.!</i>

311
00:22:42,461 --> 00:22:44,429
Shh!

312
00:22:45,429 --> 00:22:55,429

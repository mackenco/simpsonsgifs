00:00:03,903 --> 00:00:07,669
<i>The Simpsons</i>

2
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:12,478
D'oh!

3
00:00:26,793 --> 00:00:30,251
Live from the famous
brown sands of Public Beach, Delaware...

4
00:00:30,363 --> 00:00:34,390
<i>it's the Grand Nationals
of Sand Castle Building... Preview.</i>

5
00:00:34,501 --> 00:00:38,631
Oh! Saturday afternoon TV
is so boring.

6
00:00:38,738 --> 00:00:41,172
- Bikini girls.
- Hmm?

7
00:00:41,274 --> 00:00:43,469
- Dune buggies.
- Hmm!

8
00:00:43,576 --> 00:00:47,273
Daredevil surfers.

9
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:51,373
Ordinarily this beach would be swarming
with them, but not today. Oh, no!

10
00:00:51,484 --> 00:00:55,580
They've all been cleared out to make way
for painstaking sand preparation.

11
00:00:55,688 --> 00:00:58,714
That's right, Dick. This year
everyone's abuzz about one thing-

12
00:00:58,825 --> 00:01:01,350
the absence of Mark Rodkin.

13
00:01:01,461 --> 00:01:05,022
Oh, wait. There he is.

14
00:01:05,131 --> 00:01:08,225
- Marge, I'm bored!
- Why don't you read something?

15
00:01:08,334 --> 00:01:10,802
<i>Because I'm trying
to reduce my boredom.</i>

16
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:14,203
You can hand out these flyers
for the neighborhood rummage sale.

17
00:01:14,307 --> 00:01:15,501
You'll get some fresh air and exercise.

18
00:01:15,608 --> 00:01:17,103
Eh, I'll do it anyway.

19
00:01:22,949 --> 00:01:24,712
Come on, boy!
We're going to see the neighbors.

20
00:01:24,818 --> 00:01:26,752
Good old Evergreen Terrace.

21
00:01:26,853 --> 00:01:30,550
The swankiest street in the classiest part
of Pressboard Estates.

22
00:01:30,657 --> 00:01:32,750
If you love it so much,
why are you always littering?

23
00:01:32,859 --> 00:01:33,889
It's easier. Duh!

24
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:55,474
Oh! Howdy, neighbor!

25
00:01:55,582 --> 00:01:58,210
May I spray you with the hose
in a playful fashion?

26
00:01:58,318 --> 00:02:00,309
Eh, spray the boy.

27
00:02:02,822 --> 00:02:05,290
Well, ready
for the big rummage sale?

28
00:02:05,391 --> 00:02:07,291
Oh, yes, indeed.

29
00:02:07,393 --> 00:02:10,487
I've got nothing but time until they fix
that malfunctioning Squishy machine.

30
00:02:20,173 --> 00:02:23,700
<i>Hey, I never noticed this place.</i>

31
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:26,244
Dad, it's right across
the street from us.

32
00:02:26,346 --> 00:02:28,314
That fancy house will never sell.

33
00:02:28,414 --> 00:02:31,042
Nobody who could afford it
would want to live in this neighborhood.

34
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:34,245
Hey, what's wrong with this neighborhood?
Big shot!

35
00:02:34,354 --> 00:02:36,515
Too good to buy a house here, snobby?

36
00:02:36,623 --> 00:02:39,148
- Who you talking to, Homer?
- The guy who doesn't live there.

37
00:02:39,259 --> 00:02:41,727
Can we get rid
of this ayatollah T-shirt?

38
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:43,728
Khomeini died years ago.

39
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:46,264
But, Marge,
it works on any ayatollah-

40
00:02:46,366 --> 00:02:49,631
Ayatollah Nakhbadeh,
Ayatollah Zahedi.

41
00:02:49,736 --> 00:02:54,139
As we speak, Ayatollah Razmara and his cadre
of fanatics are consolidating their power.

42
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:57,141
I don't care
who's consolidating their power.

43
00:02:57,243 --> 00:02:59,143
Well, we don't need this.

44
00:02:59,245 --> 00:03:02,442
Marge, that's
the Rhinestone Nights Fashion Gun!

45
00:03:02,549 --> 00:03:06,349
- I need it to rhinestone up my old clothing.
- Who's "Disco Stu"?

46
00:03:06,452 --> 00:03:09,580
Oh. Well, I wanted to write "Disco Stud,"
but I ran out of space.

47
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:13,022
Not that Disco Stu
didn't get his share of the action.

48
00:03:17,664 --> 00:03:20,132
So, if you're looking for
a half bag of charcoal briquettes...

49
00:03:20,233 --> 00:03:22,667
or an artificial Christmas tree,
trunk only...

50
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:25,203
come on over to the Hibbert table,
pronto!

51
00:03:25,305 --> 00:03:28,468
Well, sir, looks like we got
some nice items here at Table Glick.

52
00:03:28,575 --> 00:03:31,408
Like this. What the heckaroonie
is this, Mrs. Glick?

53
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:34,207
It is a candy dish, Ned.
Ninety dollars.

54
00:03:34,314 --> 00:03:38,717
Uh-huh. Well, I, uh- I guess you
could put a lot of nice things in there.

55
00:03:38,818 --> 00:03:41,378
No! Just candy, Ned.
Ninety dollars!

56
00:03:45,525 --> 00:03:48,221
Well, looks like somebody
sold something today.

57
00:03:50,964 --> 00:03:54,297
Are you interested in that motorized tie rack,
Principal Skinner?

58
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,302
Hmm. It's awfully loud.

59
00:03:58,404 --> 00:04:01,396
Well, you can always
take the motor out...

60
00:04:01,507 --> 00:04:03,532
and use it as an ordinary tie rack.

61
00:04:03,643 --> 00:04:06,111
But now the ties are motionless.

62
00:04:06,212 --> 00:04:08,680
Those in back
are virtually inaccessible.

63
00:04:08,781 --> 00:04:11,875
Well, it's a moot point as I have
only one tie to begin with.

64
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:14,146
I believe I'll pass.

65
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:16,154
Have you sold that tie rack yet?

66
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,156
- No.
- I'll take it.

67
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:20,283
Now, folks, nothing spells fun...

68
00:04:20,393 --> 00:04:23,089
like rhinestones on a dungaree jacket.

69
00:04:23,196 --> 00:04:25,164
Stu, you should buy that.

70
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:28,928
Hey. Disco Stu doesn't advertise.

71
00:04:29,035 --> 00:04:31,936
Uh, hey, Ned,
let me help you with that.

72
00:04:32,038 --> 00:04:34,598
Hey, everybody!
Who thinks Flanders should shut up?

73
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:41,141
So, anyone here
from Evergreen Terrace?

74
00:04:42,715 --> 00:04:45,377
I think this is
the best neighborhood in town.

75
00:04:45,485 --> 00:04:47,476
Anybody agree with me?

76
00:04:47,587 --> 00:04:51,023
- You're the king, Homer!
- King of the neighborhood!

77
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:56,391
Say, that ayatollah thinks he's better
than America. Is he right?

78
00:04:56,496 --> 00:04:59,329
<i>- No!
- Yes.</i>

79
00:04:59,432 --> 00:05:04,631
- For only five dollars, you can sock it to him in style.
- Right here!

80
00:05:04,737 --> 00:05:09,197
And for the man who has everything,
a tie-rack motor.

81
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:14,042
I'll take that.

82
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:17,639
Hey, big spender

83
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,775
Dig this blender

84
00:05:19,886 --> 00:05:21,945
Rainbow suspenders

85
00:05:22,055 --> 00:05:23,955
Hey, big spender

86
00:05:24,057 --> 00:05:26,150
We surrender

87
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:30,561
Spend

88
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:33,962
Some dough at table three

89
00:05:40,406 --> 00:05:42,533
Thank you, neighbors. Thank you.

90
00:05:42,642 --> 00:05:46,840
Now, let's give it up for table five!

91
00:05:46,946 --> 00:05:50,643
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Table five, table five

92
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:52,718
Ah, ah, ah, ah

93
00:05:52,819 --> 00:06:00,316
Table fi-i-i-ive

94
00:06:00,426 --> 00:06:02,394
Table five

95
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:04,463
Table five

96
00:06:04,564 --> 00:06:06,657
Hey, what's the big deal?

97
00:06:06,766 --> 00:06:08,825
It's just some new guy moving in.

98
00:06:08,935 --> 00:06:13,269
Disco Stu likes disco music.

99
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:30,083
Hi there, neighbors.
Uh, I'm George Bush.

100
00:06:33,359 --> 00:06:36,294
Former president George Bush?

101
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:38,762
<i>Oh, former president George Bush!</i>

102
00:06:38,865 --> 00:06:42,392
Okay, let's give it up for the new guy!

103
00:06:42,502 --> 00:06:45,903
Now, let's all turn around
and pay attention to me again.

104
00:06:46,005 --> 00:06:49,133
Hello. Hello!

105
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:51,142
Hello!

106
00:06:54,447 --> 00:06:58,247
Wow! A former president
living right across the street!

107
00:06:58,351 --> 00:07:02,082
Oh, why did he have to move in
on my territory? Look at him.

108
00:07:02,188 --> 00:07:05,385
Thinks just because he led the free world
he can act like a big shot!

109
00:07:05,491 --> 00:07:09,450
Stupid president! Why couldn't he
just stay in his own state?

110
00:07:09,562 --> 00:07:13,498
Actually, this is one of the nine states
where Mr. Bush claims residency, Dad.

111
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:17,000
I wouldn't have voted for him, but it's nice
to have a celebrity in the neighborhood.

112
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:22,063
Wait a minute. If Lisa didn't vote for him,
and I didn't vote for him-

113
00:07:22,175 --> 00:07:24,143
You didn't vote for anybody.

114
00:07:24,243 --> 00:07:27,440
I voted for Prell to go back
to the old glass bottle.

115
00:07:27,547 --> 00:07:29,845
After that, I became deeply cynical.

116
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:32,713
And your business here, Mr. Flanders?

117
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:37,347
Well, sir, I'm welcoming the Bushes
on behalf of the neighborhood association.

118
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:39,448
Never mind about that, Ray.

119
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:42,528
Just give 'em a quick pass with
the metal detector and let 'em on in.

120
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:44,528
Hey, Bar! The neighbors are here.

121
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:47,531
Howdilly-doodilly there,
President Bush-

122
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:49,863
Or should I say President Neighbor?

123
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:53,530
I'm Ned Flanders,
and this is Maude, Rod and Todd.

124
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:57,336
Howdilly-doodilly yourself there, Ned.
This is my wife, Barbara.

125
00:07:57,443 --> 00:07:59,536
Call her Bar.
Would you like some lemonade?

126
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:01,545
- Tiptop-notch!
- Okilly-dokilly.

127
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:03,615
Thankilly-dankilly.

128
00:08:03,716 --> 00:08:05,616
- Greatalicious.
- Scrumpdiddlerific.

129
00:08:05,718 --> 00:08:07,743
Fine and dandy like sour candy!

130
00:08:07,854 --> 00:08:10,379
Bar's a whiz with cold drinks,
aren't you, Bar?

131
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:13,618
Don't understand lemonade myself.
Not my forte.

132
00:08:13,726 --> 00:08:16,058
What brings you to Springfield?

133
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:18,630
George and I just wanted
to be private citizens again...

134
00:08:18,731 --> 00:08:21,097
go where nobody cared about politics.

135
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:24,260
So we found the town with the lowest
voter turnout in America.

136
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:27,066
Just happy to be here
among good, average people...

137
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:29,801
with no particular hopes or dreams.

138
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:33,811
But, Mr. President,
we're not all good people.

139
00:08:33,913 --> 00:08:36,404
There's one little boy
you should watch out for.

140
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:38,609
He's a bad, bad little boy.

141
00:08:38,718 --> 00:08:42,017
Now, Todd, don't scare the president.

142
00:08:55,835 --> 00:08:59,396
Oh, look at those phonies
sucking up to Bush.

143
00:09:03,809 --> 00:09:08,439
I guess you might say he's barking
up the wrong Bush.

144
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:12,040
There it is, Homer. The cleverest
thing you'll ever say, and nobody heard it.

145
00:09:12,151 --> 00:09:13,277
D'oh!

146
00:09:15,488 --> 00:09:20,289
<i>Just gonna relax with
my U.S. News & World whatnot.</i>

147
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:23,260
Oh, good. Roasting the new guy.

148
00:09:23,362 --> 00:09:27,059
Hello, Mr. Bush!

149
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:30,795
<i>George, this is a neighborhood boy,
Bart Simpson.</i>

150
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:33,565
- He came over to say hi.
- Yeah. Hello.

151
00:09:33,673 --> 00:09:37,473
- Hi! Hey, what's this?
- My electric card shuffler. Don't go near that-

152
00:09:39,545 --> 00:09:43,276
<i>Now, I told you- Oh, those cards
are from Air Force One...</i>

153
00:09:43,382 --> 00:09:45,577
and they only give you so many packs.

154
00:09:45,685 --> 00:09:48,654
Oh, George! Boys will be boys.
Bart's just being friendly.

155
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:51,689
Why don't you get off that sofa
and show Bart your photos?

156
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:53,759
Oh, but he'll gunk 'em all up.

157
00:09:53,859 --> 00:09:56,350
His hands are probably covered
with mud and cookies.

158
00:09:56,462 --> 00:09:59,920
He probably stole a napkin.

159
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:04,128
- Who's that, George?
- That's me with Charlton Heston.

160
00:10:04,236 --> 00:10:06,136
- He was-
- Who's that, George?

161
00:10:06,238 --> 00:10:09,366
You wouldn't know him.
That's Bob Mosbacher. He was secretary of-

162
00:10:09,475 --> 00:10:11,443
That's a dumb name.
Who's that, George?

163
00:10:11,544 --> 00:10:13,512
Maybe he thinks "Bart" is a dumb-

164
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:16,173
- How many times were you president, George?
- Just once.

165
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:18,409
Bar, isn't it time for dinner yet?

166
00:10:18,517 --> 00:10:20,815
<i>I'm making rice. It'll be a while.</i>

167
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:23,388
Did your Secret Service goons
ever whack anybody, George?

168
00:10:23,489 --> 00:10:25,389
You know, in my day...

169
00:10:25,491 --> 00:10:29,052
little boys didn't call their elders
by their first names.

170
00:10:29,161 --> 00:10:31,686
Yeah? Well, welcome
to the 20th century, George.

171
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:35,324
I'll kick you right out
of the 20th century, you little-

172
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:41,831
Oh, man. I only got one minute till they
stop serving those breakfast balls! D'oh!

173
00:10:41,941 --> 00:10:45,138
Ah, let's see now.
What do you folks have here, huh?

174
00:10:45,244 --> 00:10:48,042
Hmm. A Krusty Burger.
That doesn't sound too appetizing.

175
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:50,342
What kind of stew do you have today?

176
00:10:50,449 --> 00:10:52,679
Uh, we don't have stew.

177
00:10:52,785 --> 00:10:56,380
Sir, why don't you just have the cheeseburger?

178
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:58,957
That's really more
of a weekend thing, Ray.

179
00:10:59,058 --> 00:11:01,288
Hey, jerk! Move your fanny!

180
00:11:01,394 --> 00:11:03,385
That guy's louder than World War II.

181
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:06,761
Ray, go see what the rhubarb is,
will you?

182
00:11:06,866 --> 00:11:09,334
Sir, could you pop your hood?

183
00:11:11,971 --> 00:11:14,496
Hey, my taxes paid for that horn!

184
00:11:14,607 --> 00:11:16,598
Why, hello, Mrs. Bush.

185
00:11:16,709 --> 00:11:19,735
Hi, Bart. Mr. Bush is upstairs napping.

186
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:21,710
Your husband's awful grumpy.

187
00:11:21,814 --> 00:11:24,749
Oh, that's just his way.
He really likes you.

188
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:28,183
You know, it's time for him
to get up and work on his memoirs.

189
00:11:28,287 --> 00:11:30,517
<i>Why don't you go wake him?</i>

190
00:11:30,623 --> 00:11:33,421
<i>What the-</i>

191
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:37,826
Great Scott! Don't touch that.
That's the alpenhorn Helmut Kohl gave me.

192
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:40,728
- Where'd you get those pajamas?
- They're presidential pajamas.

193
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:43,393
You have to be president,
and you're not president.

194
00:11:43,502 --> 00:11:46,403
- Yes, I am.
- D- No, you're not. Bar!

195
00:11:50,609 --> 00:11:53,578
- Hey, where's your candy?
- We don't have any. Now, go away!

196
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:55,772
George!

197
00:11:55,881 --> 00:12:00,477
Older people don't eat much candy, Bart,
but I could bake you some cookies.

198
00:12:00,586 --> 00:12:04,113
<i>Can't remember
the last time she made cookies for me.</i>

199
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,850
- What's that?
- Oh, n-nothing.

200
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:08,859
All right. His story checks out.

201
00:12:08,961 --> 00:12:11,987
Marge, would you love me more
if I were president?

202
00:12:12,098 --> 00:12:14,293
'Cause I'll do it
if it'll make you happy.

203
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:19,360
Homie, as long as you keep the car
full of gas, I'm happy.

204
00:12:19,472 --> 00:12:21,940
Well, you can always
depend on that.

205
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:26,439
And since I'd achieved...

206
00:12:26,545 --> 00:12:31,005
all my goals as president
in one term...

207
00:12:31,117 --> 00:12:34,143
there was no need for a second.

208
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:36,813
<i>The end.</i>

209
00:12:38,157 --> 00:12:40,625
Mmm. Good memoirs.

210
00:12:40,726 --> 00:12:42,421
Good, not great.

211
00:12:42,528 --> 00:12:44,655
Now, let's look at that old outboard.

212
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:47,995
Soup that baby up, rattle a few windows
down Kennebunkport next May.

213
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:52,264
Hello, Mr. Bush!

214
00:12:55,174 --> 00:12:58,109
- What ya doin'?
- Now, don't upset the desk there.

215
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:01,008
- Careful! You don't want to horse around with-
- Hey, cool! What does this do?

216
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:03,741
Now, don't you pull that cord, young man!

217
00:13:03,849 --> 00:13:05,749
<i>- No, no. Hey.!
- Whoops.</i>

218
00:13:05,851 --> 00:13:08,877
Bar, my motor's gone loco!

219
00:13:08,988 --> 00:13:13,687
Oh, the birdhouse!
My prize orchids!

220
00:13:23,335 --> 00:13:26,304
<i>No. Not the memoirs.
Don't even think about it.</i>

221
00:13:26,405 --> 00:13:28,703
Not gonna happen.

222
00:13:37,183 --> 00:13:39,515
- Whoa, man.
- Whoa nothing.

223
00:13:39,618 --> 00:13:44,317
I'm gonna do something your daddy
should've done a long time ago.

224
00:13:47,793 --> 00:13:50,762
Now, go home and think about
what you've done, young man.

225
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:54,800
He spanked you?

226
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:57,027
You? Bart Simpson?

227
00:13:57,136 --> 00:14:00,264
I begged him to stop, but he said
it was for the good of the nation.

228
00:14:00,372 --> 00:14:05,139
Big deal! When I was a pup, we got spanked
by presidents till the cows came home.

229
00:14:05,244 --> 00:14:08,873
Grover Cleveland spanked me
on two nonconsecutive occasions!

230
00:14:08,981 --> 00:14:12,314
Grampa, I know in your day
spanking was common...

231
00:14:12,418 --> 00:14:15,478
but Homer and I just don't believe
in that kind of punishment.

232
00:14:15,588 --> 00:14:18,216
And that's why your no-good kids
are running wild!

233
00:14:19,725 --> 00:14:22,853
First, Bush invades my home turf,
then he takes my pals...

234
00:14:22,962 --> 00:14:25,658
then he makes fun
of the way I talk... probably.

235
00:14:25,764 --> 00:14:30,201
Now he steals my right to raise
a disobedient, smart-alecky son!

236
00:14:30,302 --> 00:14:32,327
Well, that's it!

237
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:37,497
Hey, Bush! Get out here!

238
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:39,908
Excuse me, sir.
Where are you going?

239
00:14:40,012 --> 00:14:42,378
I'm going to punch George Bush
in the face.

240
00:14:42,481 --> 00:14:44,346
Okay. Is he expecting you?

241
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:47,578
- You owe me an apology!
- Hey, you owe me an apology.

242
00:14:47,686 --> 00:14:49,745
If you were any kind of a father...

243
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:52,824
<i>you'd have disciplined that boy
a long time ago.</i>

244
00:14:52,925 --> 00:14:55,359
You want to step back, sir?
You're trampling the flowers.

245
00:14:55,461 --> 00:14:59,363
Ooh! Hiding behind
your goons, eh, Bush?

246
00:14:59,465 --> 00:15:03,799
Whoa! Well, you are a wimp!

247
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:06,870
Wimp, am I?

248
00:15:06,972 --> 00:15:09,839
AgentJohnson, Agent Heintz...

249
00:15:09,942 --> 00:15:13,002
you men stand down.

250
00:15:15,781 --> 00:15:19,182
All right, mister, you want trouble,
you're gonna get trouble.

251
00:15:19,285 --> 00:15:21,344
Oh, I want trouble, all right.

252
00:15:21,453 --> 00:15:24,684
<i>- Then you're gonna get trouble.
- No, you're gonna get trouble.</i>

253
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:27,054
Oh, that's good.
That's good, 'cause I want trouble.

254
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:31,061
- Then we're agreed. There'll be trouble.
- Oh, yeah! Lots of trouble.

255
00:15:31,163 --> 00:15:33,063
- Trouble it is!
- For you.

256
00:15:33,165 --> 00:15:35,065
<i>D'oh!</i>

257
00:15:37,202 --> 00:15:39,568
This is gonna be sweet.

258
00:15:39,672 --> 00:15:44,234
Two hundred bottle rockets, and George Bush
doing toe touches by an open window.

259
00:15:44,343 --> 00:15:47,335
<i>You get one up his butt, it's a million points.</i>

260
00:15:54,019 --> 00:15:57,182
<i>Why don't you just
say you're sorry, George?</i>

261
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:59,814
Because I'm right. Oh, no.

262
00:15:59,925 --> 00:16:04,487
I'm gonna fix their wagon good.
I've pulled some pranks in my time.

263
00:16:05,931 --> 00:16:08,456
<i>I- I don't understand.</i>

264
00:16:08,567 --> 00:16:11,035
<i>Are you saying you and Barbara
are bad neighbors?</i>

265
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:13,366
No! That's not Bar and me.
It's them.

266
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:16,771
- Who? Maude and me?
- No! The man and his boy.

267
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:19,343
You know, the-
the boy is named Bart.

268
00:16:19,445 --> 00:16:22,437
I don't know the name of the man.
Bar! What's the name of the man?

269
00:16:22,548 --> 00:16:25,210
<i>- I'm not getting involved, George.
- Look, just never mind.</i>

270
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:29,651
I thought the banner was pretty straightforward,
but I guess I'll just take it down.

271
00:16:29,755 --> 00:16:32,656
<i>George, it's time to get dressed.</i>

272
00:16:32,758 --> 00:16:36,216
Nuh-uh. Not going outside today,
not with those neighbors.

273
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:39,354
Staying right here
till my speech to the Elks Club.

274
00:16:39,465 --> 00:16:41,729
<i>Yoo-hoo.!</i>

275
00:16:43,802 --> 00:16:48,398
<i>- Who is it?
- It's your sons, George Bush Jr. and Jeb Bush.</i>

276
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:50,532
<i>- Come outside, Dad.
- Oh, good.</i>

277
00:16:50,642 --> 00:16:54,601
Bar! The boys are in the front yard. They'll
help me think of a plan to get those Simpsons.

278
00:16:54,713 --> 00:16:57,273
Oh, George!
Is that all you ever think about?

279
00:16:57,383 --> 00:16:59,817
The boys probably just want
a letter of recommendation.

280
00:17:03,222 --> 00:17:06,419
- Boys? Where are you going?
- Okay, son. Give him the glue!

281
00:17:10,596 --> 00:17:14,032
<i>Hey, lookin'good.!</i>

282
00:17:16,168 --> 00:17:20,298
<i>And that's why I will continue
to oppose teen alcoholism...</i>

283
00:17:20,406 --> 00:17:23,102
in all its forms.

284
00:17:25,811 --> 00:17:28,575
Now, are there any questions?

285
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:33,310
Keeping in mind that I already
explained about my hair.

286
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:35,546
Oh, yeah, that's right.
The Simpsons.

287
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:47,194
President Bush
is driving on our lawn.

288
00:17:47,299 --> 00:17:50,234
- He must be lost.
- He's not lost.

289
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:53,304
Looks like we're experiencing
some blowback from the wig offensive.

290
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:55,999
- It's time to hit him where he lives.
- His house?

291
00:17:56,108 --> 00:17:58,008
Bingo.

292
00:18:01,847 --> 00:18:04,782
So I thought to myself,
"What would God do in this situation?"

293
00:18:04,883 --> 00:18:08,546
Locusts. They'll drive him nuts.

294
00:18:08,654 --> 00:18:12,283
It's all in the Bible, son.
It's the prankster's bible.

295
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:25,099
Hmm. I can't decide if this'll
be considered feisty or crazy.

296
00:18:25,204 --> 00:18:27,968
Hey! Hey, what the-

297
00:18:28,073 --> 00:18:30,701
Oh, if he thinks George Bush'll
stay out of the sewer...

298
00:18:30,809 --> 00:18:32,936
he doesn't know George Bush.

299
00:18:34,746 --> 00:18:37,078
Hey, turkeys! Behind ya.

300
00:18:37,182 --> 00:18:40,174
For the last time, Bush,
apologize for spanking my boy!

301
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:43,948
Never. You make him apologize
for destroying my memoirs.

302
00:18:44,056 --> 00:18:47,048
You didn't tell me
you destroyed his memoirs.

303
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:49,889
Never!

304
00:18:57,169 --> 00:19:00,900
Yea, Dad!

305
00:19:01,006 --> 00:19:03,975
I really feel awful
about your lawn, Marge.

306
00:19:04,076 --> 00:19:06,806
George can be so stubborn
when he thinks he's right.

307
00:19:06,912 --> 00:19:09,380
Oh, Homer too.
They're so much alike.

308
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:11,779
Too bad they got off
on the wrong foot.

309
00:19:11,884 --> 00:19:14,250
It's just like the Noriega thing.

310
00:19:14,353 --> 00:19:17,322
Now he and George
are the best of friends.

311
00:19:20,626 --> 00:19:23,754
Here's a little something
we learned in C.I.A.

312
00:19:27,366 --> 00:19:32,167
- Get him, boys!
- Ow! Ow!

313
00:19:36,942 --> 00:19:40,173
Hello!

314
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:42,372
Hello!

315
00:19:50,489 --> 00:19:53,356
Now I'll ruin you like a Japanese banquet.

316
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:56,916
I'll take your head and-
Gorbachev?

317
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:59,327
What-What are you doing here?

318
00:19:59,431 --> 00:20:02,400
I just dropped by with present
for warming of house.

319
00:20:02,501 --> 00:20:05,629
Instead find you grappling
with local oaf.

320
00:20:05,737 --> 00:20:09,332
Oh, brought some of your commie friends
to help you fight dirty, eh?

321
00:20:09,441 --> 00:20:13,002
Mikhail, they put a wig on my head,
my memoirs got-

322
00:20:13,111 --> 00:20:15,409
<i>George, this is the last straw.!</i>

323
00:20:15,514 --> 00:20:17,675
You apologize to Homer right now!

324
00:20:17,783 --> 00:20:21,583
But, Bar, we can't show any weakness
in front of the Russians.

325
00:20:21,687 --> 00:20:23,917
George!

326
00:20:26,758 --> 00:20:28,726
Yes, dear.

327
00:20:32,965 --> 00:20:35,365
Okay.

328
00:20:35,467 --> 00:20:38,095
I'm sorry I spanked your boy, Homer.

329
00:20:38,203 --> 00:20:41,001
Whoo-hoo! In your face, Bush.

330
00:20:41,106 --> 00:20:44,098
Now apologize for the tax hike.

331
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,178
It's a shame it didn't work out, Marge...

332
00:20:51,283 --> 00:20:54,878
but George just felt this neighborhood
brought out the worst in him and-

333
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:02,521
Oh, my. Well, so long!

334
00:21:07,566 --> 00:21:10,228
Bye-bye.

335
00:21:19,344 --> 00:21:21,869
Hi!

336
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:24,278
Pleased to meet you. I just moved in.

337
00:21:24,383 --> 00:21:26,647
My name is Jerry Ford.

338
00:21:26,752 --> 00:21:29,516
Former president Gerald Ford?

339
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:31,782
Put 'er there. I'm Homer Simpson.

340
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:36,224
- Say, Homer, do you like football?
- Do I ever!

341
00:21:36,328 --> 00:21:39,991
- Do you like nachos?
- Yes, Mr. Ford.

342
00:21:40,098 --> 00:21:43,625
Well, why don't you come over
and watch the game...

343
00:21:43,735 --> 00:21:47,171
and we'll have nachos
and then some beer?

344
00:21:47,272 --> 00:21:49,137
Ooh!

345
00:21:49,241 --> 00:21:52,972
Jerry, I think you and I
are gonna get along just-

346
00:21:53,078 --> 00:21:55,205
D'oh!

347
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:42,660
Shh!

348
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:53,660

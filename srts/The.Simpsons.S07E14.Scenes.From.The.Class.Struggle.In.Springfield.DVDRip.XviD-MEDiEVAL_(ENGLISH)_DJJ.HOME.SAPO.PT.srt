1
00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:07,337
<i>The Simpsons</i>

2
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:12,478
D'oh!

3
00:00:29,996 --> 00:00:32,430
<i>Ay.!: Qué agonía.!</i>

4
00:00:34,968 --> 00:00:38,426
Oh, he wants that corn so much.

5
00:00:40,807 --> 00:00:43,742
<i>Ay.!: Dios no me ama.!</i>

6
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:49,772
I want to see what's
on the other broadcasts.

7
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:51,817
Where's the oscillator on this thing?

8
00:00:51,918 --> 00:00:53,647
No, Grampa! Don't!

9
00:00:53,753 --> 00:00:55,550
- Dad, sit down!
- Gosh darn it!

10
00:00:55,655 --> 00:00:57,350
What does this do?

11
00:00:57,457 --> 00:01:00,324
Oh, I'll make my adjustments here and-

12
00:01:07,667 --> 00:01:11,125
Yea! We're getting a new TV!

13
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:14,798
Let's go to the Sharper Image.
They've got a TV shaped like a '50s diner!

14
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:17,035
No! Let's go to The Nature Company.

15
00:01:17,143 --> 00:01:19,634
They've got a TV
assembled by Hopi Indians.

16
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:24,877
We can't afford to shop at any store
that has a philosophy. We just need a TV.

17
00:01:24,984 --> 00:01:28,681
- We're going to go to
the outlet mall in Ogdenville.

18
00:01:47,407 --> 00:01:52,504
Look at these low, low prices
on famous brand-name electronics!

19
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:55,206
Don't be a sap, Dad.
These are just crappy knock-offs.

20
00:01:55,315 --> 00:01:58,307
I know a genuine Panaphonics
when I see it.

21
00:01:58,418 --> 00:02:01,319
And look,
there's Magnetbox and Sorny.

22
00:02:01,421 --> 00:02:04,720
I'm not going to lie to you.
Those are all superior machines.

23
00:02:04,824 --> 00:02:09,193
But if you like to watch your TV,
and I mean really watch it...

24
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:11,195
you want the Carnivalé.

25
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:14,494
It features two-pronged wall plug,
pre-molded hand-grip well...

26
00:02:14,601 --> 00:02:17,069
durable outer casing
to prevent fall-apart.

27
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:20,901
Sold! You wrap it up,
I'll start bringing in the pennies.

28
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:26,843
Honey, I don't think these clothes are us.

29
00:02:26,946 --> 00:02:28,846
Who are they?

30
00:02:28,948 --> 00:02:31,849
Hey, Brandine!
You could wear this shirt to work.

31
00:02:31,951 --> 00:02:35,079
Oh, Cletis, you know I gotta wear the shirt
what Dairy Queen give me.

32
00:02:38,024 --> 00:02:40,322
<i>Hey, Mom.!
There's something in here.!</i>

33
00:02:40,426 --> 00:02:42,326
Ooh!

34
00:02:42,428 --> 00:02:44,487
Oh, it's beautiful.

35
00:02:44,597 --> 00:02:46,497
Can it be a real Chanel?

36
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:48,567
It is!

37
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:52,570
Ninety dollars?

38
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:55,106
But it's marked down from 2,800.

39
00:03:02,882 --> 00:03:05,646
Oh, you look so sophisticated.

40
00:03:05,752 --> 00:03:07,652
Just like Mary Hart.

41
00:03:07,754 --> 00:03:09,654
It fits like a dream too.

42
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:13,123
But we can't afford $90,
even if it is a bargain.

43
00:03:13,226 --> 00:03:16,127
It wouldn't be right
to buy something just for me.

44
00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:19,665
If it were a suit we could all wear,
maybe then-

45
00:03:19,766 --> 00:03:22,200
Come on, Mom!
You never treat yourself to anything.

46
00:03:22,302 --> 00:03:27,069
Oh, sure I do. I treated myself
to a Sanka not three days ago.

47
00:03:27,173 --> 00:03:29,573
But this is a real find.

48
00:03:29,676 --> 00:03:32,668
Just buy it. You don't
have to rationalize everything.

49
00:03:32,779 --> 00:03:35,111
Hmm.

50
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:37,149
<i>All right, I will buy it!</i>

51
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,218
It'll be good for the economy.

52
00:03:44,123 --> 00:03:47,286
You look great!

53
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:49,258
Really? You like it?

54
00:03:49,362 --> 00:03:52,126
Oh, I'd love to wear this
someplace special.

55
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:55,360
Sperlock's Cafeteria it is.

56
00:03:55,468 --> 00:03:57,732
What about
the symphony or the theater?

57
00:03:57,837 --> 00:03:59,737
Oh-

58
00:03:59,839 --> 00:04:02,672
What's the point of going out?
We're just gonna wind up back here anyway.

59
00:04:16,189 --> 00:04:19,625
Oh, Mrs. Simpson,
you are looking very prosperous today.

60
00:04:19,726 --> 00:04:23,560
Might I interest you in some of our
impulse items here by the cash register?

61
00:04:23,663 --> 00:04:26,063
Perhaps a crazy motorized wiggle pen?

62
00:04:26,165 --> 00:04:28,963
Look at the craziness.

63
00:04:30,303 --> 00:04:32,965
- Attendant, I'd like some gas.
- Yes, I'm sorry.

64
00:04:33,072 --> 00:04:35,973
- I do not speak English. Okay.
- But you were just talking to-

65
00:04:36,075 --> 00:04:39,374
Yes, yes. Hot dog, hot dog.
Yes, sir. No, sir. Maybe. Okay.

66
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:42,710
Well, I can't pump it myself.
I'm calling Triple "A."

67
00:04:42,815 --> 00:04:45,306
I used to be a little overwhelmed too.
But it's not that hard.

68
00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:47,318
I can show you.

69
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:49,320
Marge, is that you?

70
00:04:49,422 --> 00:04:51,356
Marge Bouvier from high school?

71
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:55,291
Um, yeah.
Hi. Hi, Evelyn.

72
00:04:55,395 --> 00:04:58,887
How about that?
Marge, you look wonderful!

73
00:04:58,998 --> 00:05:02,729
<i>- And to think I heard you married Homer Simpson.
- I did marry Homer.</i>

74
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:06,602
Come.
You must show me the pumps.

75
00:05:06,706 --> 00:05:11,905
Ninety percent of the time if the gas
isn't pumping, this is your problem.

76
00:05:12,011 --> 00:05:14,104
<i>Automotive skills and fashion sense.</i>

77
00:05:14,213 --> 00:05:17,614
Well, you've come a long way from the girl
I knew nothing about in high school.

78
00:05:17,717 --> 00:05:19,617
We ran with different crowds.

79
00:05:19,719 --> 00:05:23,018
You had your debutante balls
and skinny-dipping...

80
00:05:23,122 --> 00:05:27,320
and I had my... home shoe-repair course.

81
00:05:27,427 --> 00:05:30,760
Oh, Marge, you haven't changed a bit
as far as I know.

82
00:05:30,863 --> 00:05:33,764
Say, why don't you drop by
the country club tomorrow?

83
00:05:33,866 --> 00:05:35,834
Oh, and bring the family!

84
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:43,538
You there. Fill it up
with petroleum distillate.

85
00:05:43,643 --> 00:05:45,975
And revulcanize my tires, posthaste.

86
00:05:49,248 --> 00:05:51,148
Bart, comb your hair!

87
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:54,651
Homer, I don't think you should wear
a short-sleeved shirt with a tie.

88
00:05:54,754 --> 00:05:56,654
Oh, but Sipowicz does it.

89
00:05:56,756 --> 00:05:59,657
If Detective Sipowicz jumped off a cliff,
would you do that too?

90
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,590
Oh, I wish I was Sipowicz.

91
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:03,594
Do I have to go?

92
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:07,723
That country club is a hotbed of exclusionist
snobs and status-seeking social climbers.

93
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:10,735
I've told you, I don't like
you using the word "hotbed. "

94
00:06:10,837 --> 00:06:13,897
Please, Lisa. We so rarely
get to do things like this.

95
00:06:14,006 --> 00:06:17,100
And, everybody, everybody please
be on your best behavior.

96
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,110
Bart, no grifting.

97
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:22,045
Aw, raspberries.

98
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:27,818
- Name, please?
- Simpson family.

99
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,945
We're not poor.

100
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:32,957
Well, we're not.

101
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:35,459
Go on in.
They're expecting you at the clubhouse.

102
00:06:40,533 --> 00:06:42,091
- Look at this!
- Livin' large!

103
00:06:42,201 --> 00:06:43,828
Oh, my!

104
00:06:43,936 --> 00:06:46,200
<i>I've always dreamed of coming here.</i>

105
00:06:46,305 --> 00:06:49,638
<i>Everybody keep smiling,
and I know we're going to fit right in.</i>

106
00:07:02,054 --> 00:07:04,022
<i>Marge, you made it.!
And you wore that lovely suit.</i>

107
00:07:04,557 --> 00:07:07,526
<i>Karyn, Gillian, Eliza-beth...</i>

108
00:07:07,627 --> 00:07:12,064
<i>Patri-cia, Robert-a, Su-san,
meet Marge.</i>

109
00:07:12,165 --> 00:07:14,065
- Hi.
- How are you doing?

110
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:16,397
Pleased to meet you.

111
00:07:16,502 --> 00:07:20,563
You look like such
a happy bunch... of people.

112
00:07:20,673 --> 00:07:24,905
That's the trouble with first impressions-
you only get to make one.

113
00:07:28,681 --> 00:07:31,582
Th-That reminds me
of a funny apron I saw-

114
00:07:31,684 --> 00:07:34,676
You know, Marge, your family
doesn't have to stand in the alcove.

115
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:36,687
<i>They're free to enjoy the club.</i>

116
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:38,919
Uh, come on, kids. Let's go sit in the car
till your mom's done fitting in.

117
00:07:45,698 --> 00:07:47,131
Eliza-beth is right.

118
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:49,861
Why shout yourself hoarse at
incompetent sales clerks...

119
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:52,870
when you can get
nearly everything mail-order?

120
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:56,931
I won't eat anything unless it's shipped
overnight from Vermont or Washington state.

121
00:07:57,043 --> 00:07:59,739
<i>We order our steaks
through The New Yorker.</i>

122
00:07:59,846 --> 00:08:04,215
I have a sneaking suspicion that L.L. Bean
and Eddie Bauer are selling me the same honey.

123
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,220
<i>I get food through the mail,
but in a different way.</i>

124
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:13,554
<i>Every month, Good Housekeeping
arrives in my mailbox bursting with recipes.</i>

125
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:17,322
<i>Sometimes the most satisfying meal
is the one you cook yourself.</i>

126
00:08:18,364 --> 00:08:20,696
Hmm.
That's very true, Marge.

127
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,497
One night, Wiff and I came home late,
and we decided not to wake Iris.

128
00:08:24,604 --> 00:08:27,505
Instead,
we microwaved our own soup!

129
00:08:30,142 --> 00:08:32,042
Of course it was a horrible mess.

130
00:08:32,144 --> 00:08:34,271
But Iris didn't mind cleaning it up.

131
00:08:40,052 --> 00:08:43,146
<i>Didn't everybody have a wonderful time?</i>

132
00:08:43,256 --> 00:08:45,156
I thought it was so opulent.

133
00:08:45,258 --> 00:08:48,022
Like the Playboy Mansion,
but non-sexual.

134
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:50,027
That place is weird.

135
00:08:50,129 --> 00:08:53,064
A man in the bathroom kept handing me towels
till I paid him to stop.

136
00:08:53,165 --> 00:08:55,065
Shoulda held out longer, boy.

137
00:08:55,167 --> 00:08:58,102
- The rich are different from you and me.
- Yes! They're better!

138
00:08:59,939 --> 00:09:03,602
Socially better.
And if we fit in, we can be better too.

139
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:08,009
So today, while the rest of you were out being
different, I did a very good job of fitting in.

140
00:09:08,114 --> 00:09:12,107
So good that Evelyn gave us a guest pass.
They might even ask us to join.

141
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:14,118
Boy, Marge!

142
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,650
You must've really done a number
on those rich suckers.

143
00:09:21,427 --> 00:09:23,662
Don't thank me.
Thank my beautiful new suit.

144
00:09:24,964 --> 00:09:27,125
Fritz, you idiot!

145
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:29,326
I didn't order a baloney sandwich!

146
00:09:29,435 --> 00:09:31,403
I ordered an abalone sandwich!

147
00:09:32,505 --> 00:09:34,268
I don't know
what Mom's thinking.

148
00:09:34,373 --> 00:09:36,273
This whole country club scene
is so decadent.

149
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:39,572
All these spoiled... brats...
and their... smug...

150
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:41,579
complacent parents.

151
00:09:41,681 --> 00:09:44,081
It just reinforces
the unspoken class system...

152
00:09:44,183 --> 00:09:47,277
of... horses... sitting
on their high... horses-

153
00:09:47,386 --> 00:09:49,650
I'm sorry! I gotta go!

154
00:09:56,729 --> 00:09:59,027
Oh, we've got a winning hand!

155
00:09:59,131 --> 00:10:01,031
We can take
the rest of the tricks.

156
00:10:01,133 --> 00:10:04,034
Oh, you'd better be careful.
The purpose of this game is to make friends.

157
00:10:04,136 --> 00:10:06,036
You don't make friends by winning.

158
00:10:06,138 --> 00:10:09,039
Still, there's nothing more popular
than a gracious winner.

159
00:10:09,141 --> 00:10:11,041
Don't ask me.
I'm just hair.

160
00:10:11,143 --> 00:10:13,634
Your head stopped 18 inches ago.

161
00:10:13,746 --> 00:10:16,214
Queen of hearts.

162
00:10:16,315 --> 00:10:18,681
I believe all the rest are ours.

163
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:20,684
Oh, well played.

164
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:23,812
We could've stopped them
if you had changed to a different suit.

165
00:10:23,923 --> 00:10:28,690
I thought perhaps changing suits
had gone out of fashion. Eh, Marge?

166
00:10:33,065 --> 00:10:35,124
D'oh!

167
00:10:35,234 --> 00:10:37,702
Ho-ho-ho! Hoo-hoo!
Ohh!

168
00:10:39,505 --> 00:10:41,473
Hmm!

169
00:10:43,576 --> 00:10:46,477
You know, Homer,
the traditional way to cheat in golf...

170
00:10:46,579 --> 00:10:48,479
<i>is to lower your score.</i>

171
00:10:48,581 --> 00:10:51,482
- That's one way.
- I'm P.G.A. Tour Pro Tom Kite.

172
00:10:51,584 --> 00:10:54,052
How about I give you a few pointers
on your game?

173
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:57,520
- Now, you don't want to overthink.
- Not an issue.

174
00:10:57,623 --> 00:10:59,523
- Keep your head down.
- Huh?

175
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:01,752
Pretend there's no one else here.

176
00:11:03,796 --> 00:11:06,788
<i>And just go at your own pace.</i>

177
00:11:08,934 --> 00:11:10,834
Wow!
Very impressive.

178
00:11:10,936 --> 00:11:12,836
You're a natural, Mr. Simpson.

179
00:11:12,938 --> 00:11:16,169
- Really?
- Uh-huh. All you need is your own set of clubs.

180
00:11:16,275 --> 00:11:18,869
And stay the hell out of my locker!

181
00:11:18,978 --> 00:11:20,468
You can keep the shoes.

182
00:11:23,616 --> 00:11:27,177
Marge, did you know that Kennedy and Lincoln
had the same handicap?

183
00:11:27,286 --> 00:11:31,245
Homer, please. I have to alter this suit
so it looks different for tomorrow.

184
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:36,658
Just slap some bumper stickers on it
and come to bed, will you, Marge?

185
00:11:44,303 --> 00:11:46,203
Love your outfit, Marge.

186
00:11:46,305 --> 00:11:49,433
The vest says, "Let's have lunch,"
but the culottes say, "You're paying. "

187
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:52,272
Why, thank you, Robert-A!

188
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:56,405
<i>Mom, look.! I found something
more fun than complaining.!</i>

189
00:11:58,617 --> 00:12:01,950
<i>Marge, your family
is fitting in perfectly here.</i>

190
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:04,750
If all goes well at Saturday's ball...

191
00:12:04,857 --> 00:12:07,325
I'd love to sponsor you
for membership.

192
00:12:07,426 --> 00:12:10,486
Oh, that would be
a dream come true!

193
00:12:10,596 --> 00:12:12,496
I'll be there with bells on.

194
00:12:12,598 --> 00:12:14,498
<i>Bells?</i>

195
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,501
Where exactly will you be attaching them
to that mangled Chanel suit?

196
00:12:19,605 --> 00:12:21,505
Oh, don't worry, Marge.

197
00:12:21,607 --> 00:12:24,508
Her idea of wit is nothing more
than an incisive observation...

198
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:26,840
humorously phrased
and delivered with impeccable timing.

199
00:12:26,946 --> 00:12:32,213
I'm sure you'll be a smash at the ball,
and I just know you'll have a lovely new outfit.

200
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,418
- That's some fine chipping, Homer.
- Yeah.

201
00:12:42,528 --> 00:12:44,553
Can you bank it into
the handicapped stall?

202
00:12:44,663 --> 00:12:46,358
Seat down.

203
00:12:50,836 --> 00:12:54,738
Hmm. Who is that
lavatory linksman, Smithers?

204
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:58,503
Homer Simpson, sir. One of the
fork-and-spoon operators from Sector 7G.

205
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:00,772
Well, he's certainly
got a loose waggle.

206
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,407
Perhaps I've finally found a golfer
worthy of a match with Monty Burns, eh?

207
00:13:04,517 --> 00:13:09,284
Oh, his waggle is no match for yours, sir.
I've never seen you lose a game.

208
00:13:09,388 --> 00:13:13,017
Except for that one in '74 when you let
Richard Nixon win. That was very kind of you, sir.

209
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:16,219
Oh, he just looked so forlorn,
Smithers, with his...

210
00:13:16,328 --> 00:13:20,196
"I can't go to prison, Monty.
They'll eat me alive!"

211
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:24,360
Say, I wonder if this Homer Nixon is any relation?

212
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:27,701
Unlikely, sir. They-They spell
and pronounce their name differently.

213
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:30,867
Bah! Schedule a game
and I'll ask him myself.

214
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:34,739
This game could mean
big things for me, Marge.

215
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:38,078
If I beat Mr. Burns,
I mean, really wallop him bad...

216
00:13:38,184 --> 00:13:41,085
I'm sure to get that big raise
I've been gunning for.

217
00:13:41,187 --> 00:13:44,918
All right, but if you win, don't make a scene
and dance around with your "whoo-hoo's. "

218
00:13:45,024 --> 00:13:48,824
Please! We can't afford a single slip-up.
They're judging us.

219
00:13:48,928 --> 00:13:52,295
Mwah. Mwah!

220
00:13:52,398 --> 00:13:54,889
Mom, did you like horses
when you were my age? 'Cause I heard-

221
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,696
I don't know.
Lisa, tonight is very important.

222
00:13:57,803 --> 00:14:00,966
Mommy has to alter her suit
so it looks like a totally new one.

223
00:14:01,073 --> 00:14:04,634
Mom, do you want to know the 15 reasons
I like horses better than cars? One-

224
00:14:04,743 --> 00:14:07,211
I really need to concentrate on this.
Would you mind just-

225
00:14:07,313 --> 00:14:09,406
You know how a horse goes like this?

226
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:13,451
- Mom! - I've altered this so many
times, it's nearly impossible to-

227
00:14:13,552 --> 00:14:15,884
Whee! Whee!
Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom!

228
00:14:15,988 --> 00:14:18,149
Lisa, please!

229
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:26,498
Hmm.

230
00:14:27,266 --> 00:14:29,325
No!

231
00:14:29,435 --> 00:14:31,995
No, no, no, no!

232
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:40,740
At times like this
I guess all you can do is laugh.

233
00:14:48,087 --> 00:14:51,454
<i>I need a formal dress for tonight!</i>

234
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:53,457
You've come to the right place.

235
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:55,823
We've got classy duds
up the ying-yang.

236
00:14:55,928 --> 00:14:58,692
I call this one "Fantasy in Maroon. "

237
00:14:58,797 --> 00:15:02,062
It's got some cigarette burns,
but we can patch them up with Nu Vinyl.

238
00:15:02,167 --> 00:15:05,068
It's a bit peppery for me.

239
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:07,934
Why don't we put this
in the "maybe" pile?

240
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,907
This was originally
a Halloween costume...

241
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:13,979
but it found its way
into my regular rotation.

242
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:15,569
Uh-huh.

243
00:15:16,682 --> 00:15:18,445
Good morning, Mr. Burns.

244
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:20,415
Beautiful day to be outside,
isn't it?

245
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:23,420
Rant on, Simpson,
but your vainglorious boasting...

246
00:15:23,522 --> 00:15:26,582
will only add savor
to my inevitable triumph.

247
00:15:26,692 --> 00:15:28,660
Yes.

248
00:15:32,364 --> 00:15:34,059
Whoo-hoo!

249
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:36,066
D'oh!

250
00:15:36,168 --> 00:15:39,137
Yes.
You're in deep "d'oh" now.

251
00:15:48,681 --> 00:15:52,310
Perfect as always, sir.
Right on the green.

252
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:04,357
Oh, quit cogitating, Steinmetz,
and use an open-faced club- the sand wedge!

253
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:06,363
Mmm.

254
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:09,195
Open-faced club sand wedge.

255
00:16:14,873 --> 00:16:17,171
You're four strokes behind, Simpson.

256
00:16:23,382 --> 00:16:25,282
Oh, a cunning stratagem, sir.

257
00:16:25,384 --> 00:16:27,909
It's curving right toward the green.

258
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,920
And it's...

259
00:16:30,022 --> 00:16:31,922
there!

260
00:16:32,024 --> 00:16:35,221
He got to the green in one shot?

261
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:38,319
How can that old man...

262
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:41,456
hit so far?

263
00:16:41,567 --> 00:16:43,467
Now, keep your head down.

264
00:16:43,569 --> 00:16:45,469
Ignore all distractions.

265
00:16:53,946 --> 00:16:55,846
Miss! Miss?

266
00:16:55,948 --> 00:16:59,145
Do you have a Chanel suit,
or any other high-quality clothes?

267
00:16:59,251 --> 00:17:04,314
No, but we do have a shipment of slightly burnt
Sears activewear coming in this afternoon.

268
00:17:04,423 --> 00:17:06,448
Oh, I give up.

269
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:08,458
What time, and how burnt?

270
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:12,621
Cripes, man! Can't you ever get
to the green in less than two shots?

271
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:20,437
Smithers,
what are you doing up here?

272
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:22,200
What are you doing with his ball?

273
00:17:22,307 --> 00:17:24,207
And all those other balls?

274
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:26,470
Uh, there are no other balls.

275
00:17:26,578 --> 00:17:30,036
Just these, uh, reptile eggs!
Oh, step away! They're endangered.

276
00:17:33,118 --> 00:17:35,052
These aren't reptile eggs.

277
00:17:35,154 --> 00:17:37,054
You've been cheating!

278
00:17:37,156 --> 00:17:39,989
No matter where Mr. Burns hits the ball,
you put a fresh one on the green!

279
00:17:40,092 --> 00:17:42,652
Cheating? For me?

280
00:17:42,761 --> 00:17:45,662
Good lord, Smithers!
That's patently unnecessary.

281
00:17:45,764 --> 00:17:48,096
I'm one of the world's finest golfers.

282
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:52,000
In all of the years you've caddied for me,
I've never lost a-

283
00:17:52,104 --> 00:17:54,004
Oh.

284
00:17:54,106 --> 00:17:57,007
So you're not the best golfer here.

285
00:17:57,109 --> 00:18:00,135
Wait till I tell everyone about this.

286
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:02,076
You stink.

287
00:18:02,181 --> 00:18:04,411
Homer, Mr. Burns
holds a lot of sway at this club.

288
00:18:04,516 --> 00:18:07,417
If you would keep quiet about the alleged...
decades of cheating...

289
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:09,919
I'm sure he'd support your application
for a membership tonight.

290
00:18:10,022 --> 00:18:13,185
Bull hockey! I don't care
about joining this stupid club.

291
00:18:13,292 --> 00:18:15,783
But does your wife?

292
00:18:15,894 --> 00:18:17,794
Ohh!

293
00:18:17,896 --> 00:18:22,094
<i>I knew my kind wasn't welcome here.</i>

294
00:18:32,978 --> 00:18:34,411
Ooh!

295
00:18:34,513 --> 00:18:36,640
- Ahh!
- Eee!

296
00:18:36,748 --> 00:18:39,774
Mom, you are looking fabulous!

297
00:18:39,885 --> 00:18:43,480
Yeah. You look great. You can do anything
with that sewing machine.

298
00:18:43,589 --> 00:18:45,853
No, I can't.
Come on, let's go.

299
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:49,189
- You mean it's a new dress? Where did you get it?
- The outlet store.

300
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:51,091
Wow! Two finds in one store.

301
00:18:51,196 --> 00:18:53,061
- What are the odds?
- Call it fate. Let's go!

302
00:18:53,165 --> 00:18:54,962
- How much did it cost?
- A dollar. Let's go!

303
00:18:55,067 --> 00:18:57,092
- With tax or without?
- Without! Let me go!

304
00:18:57,202 --> 00:19:00,069
- So, with tax, how much was it?
- Why do you always have to question everything I do?

305
00:19:01,173 --> 00:19:02,765
You look nice, is all.

306
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:10,547
<i>- Homer, what are you doing?
- Driving up to the main building.</i>

307
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:13,550
- They got valet parking tonight.
- We can't drive this up there.

308
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:16,746
They'll see the dent.
They'll see the coat hanger antenna.

309
00:19:16,855 --> 00:19:20,256
- Stop the car. Were walking.
- But, Marge! Valets!

310
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:24,989
For once maybe someone will call me "sir"
without adding, "You're making a scene. "

311
00:19:30,369 --> 00:19:32,462
I'm gonna regale everyone
with my anecdote.

312
00:19:32,571 --> 00:19:35,472
You know, the one I tried
to say on the radio?

313
00:19:35,574 --> 00:19:37,474
Who's gonna bleep me this time?

314
00:19:37,576 --> 00:19:39,476
I'm gonna pose as an Italian count...

315
00:19:39,578 --> 00:19:42,479
and get some old lady
to leave me all her money.

316
00:19:42,581 --> 00:19:45,482
I'm gonna ask people if they
know their servants' last names.

317
00:19:45,584 --> 00:19:47,916
Or, in the case of butlers, their first.

318
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:50,215
No, no, no! Not tonight!

319
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:55,321
<i>No vulgarity, no mischief, no politics.</i>

320
00:19:55,427 --> 00:19:57,759
Just be good!

321
00:19:57,863 --> 00:20:00,161
I'm sorry, Mom.
I'll behave.

322
00:20:00,265 --> 00:20:02,233
I won't say anything controversial.

323
00:20:02,334 --> 00:20:04,802
I just won't say anything.
Okay, honey?

324
00:20:11,743 --> 00:20:13,540
You kids should thank your mother.

325
00:20:13,645 --> 00:20:15,545
<i>Now that she's a better person...</i>

326
00:20:15,647 --> 00:20:18,115
<i>we can see how awful we really are.</i>

327
00:20:27,459 --> 00:20:30,053
Come here, Maggie.

328
00:20:30,162 --> 00:20:34,292
Oh, Homie, I like
your in-your-face humanity.

329
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:36,390
I like the way Lisa speaks her mind.

330
00:20:36,501 --> 00:20:39,061
I like Bart's-

331
00:20:39,171 --> 00:20:40,968
I like Bart.

332
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:44,065
And I like my old green dress.

333
00:20:44,176 --> 00:20:47,942
I didn't have to spend our savings
on this stupid gown.

334
00:20:48,046 --> 00:20:49,570
Our savings?

335
00:20:49,681 --> 00:20:51,581
Don't worry.
I saved the receipt.

336
00:20:51,683 --> 00:20:55,346
- We'll have a $3,300 credit at Chanel.
- They have beer and gum, right?

337
00:20:57,456 --> 00:20:59,356
Come on. Let's go.

338
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:03,292
<i>I wouldn't want to join any club
that would have this me as a member.</i>

339
00:21:03,395 --> 00:21:08,094
It's okay. Those snobs never
would've made us members anyway.

340
00:21:09,901 --> 00:21:12,028
Well, I wonder where Marge could be.

341
00:21:12,137 --> 00:21:14,196
She's missing her own initiation.

342
00:21:14,306 --> 00:21:18,208
I hope she didn't take
my attempt to destroy her too seriously.

343
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:24,541
Where's Homer? And to think
I spent all afternoon baking him this cake.

344
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:25,250
Mmm! I- Ugh!

345
00:21:25,285 --> 00:21:25,841
Mmm! I- Ugh!

346
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:33,487
I pickled the figs myself.

347
00:21:38,263 --> 00:21:42,165
- Hey, did you guys just come from the prom?
- Sort of.

348
00:21:42,267 --> 00:21:46,966
But you know, we realized we're
more comfortable in a place like this.

349
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:51,909
Man, you're crazy!
This place is a dump.

350
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:56,504
Oh, man! I'd be anywhere
except this place. That's for sure.

351
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:44,222
Shh!

352
00:22:45,222 --> 00:22:55,222

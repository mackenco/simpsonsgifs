<i>The Simpsons</i>

2
00:00:10,543 --> 00:00:12,477
D'oh!

3
00:00:36,436 --> 00:00:40,930
1796. A fiercely determined
band of pioneers leaves Maryland...

4
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:44,010
after misinterpreting
a passage in the Bible.

5
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:46,408
Their destination:
New Sodom.

6
00:00:46,513 --> 00:00:48,413
<i>This is their story.</i>

7
00:00:48,515 --> 00:00:50,415
This is gonna be great.

8
00:00:50,517 --> 00:00:53,418
I hope they show the time where
they traded guns to the Indians for corn...

9
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,488
and then the Indians shot them
and took the corn.

10
00:00:57,223 --> 00:01:00,249
- Egad! A monster!
- It's a horrible fiend!

11
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,487
It's some sort of land cow.

12
00:01:02,595 --> 00:01:05,428
Stand back, fellow settlers.

13
00:01:14,474 --> 00:01:16,704
Oh.

14
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,612
Ye have saved
our fledgling community.

15
00:01:22,715 --> 00:01:26,344
Mr. Springfield, how can I hope
to achieve such greatness?

16
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:34,249
A noble spirit
"embiggens" the smallest man.

17
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,555
- Yea!
- Springfield rules!

18
00:01:36,663 --> 00:01:38,597
Way to go, Springfield!

19
00:01:38,698 --> 00:01:42,293
"Embiggens"? Hmm. I never heard that word
before I moved to Springfield.

20
00:01:42,402 --> 00:01:44,893
I don't know why.
It's a perfectly "cromulent" word.

21
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:53,773
Now, as you all know, Springfield's
200th birthday is only a week away.

22
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,713
Every class will do its part
to make our local bicentennial...

23
00:01:56,816 --> 00:01:59,512
just as memorable as
our national bicentennial.

24
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:02,087
Of course, you children
are too young to remember that...

25
00:02:02,188 --> 00:02:04,088
with the possible
exception of Kearney.

26
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:08,957
Those tall ships really lifted the nation's
spirits after Watergate.

27
00:02:09,062 --> 00:02:11,030
To celebrate our bicentennial,
all 20 of you...

28
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:14,032
will write an essay
aboutJebediah Springfield...

29
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:17,194
and the best 18 will be put on file
in the school library...

30
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:19,203
available to anyone
who requests them.

31
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:21,705
- Can we do illustrations?
- No.

32
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:28,106
Hey. They need volunteers to play
old-timey people in the parade.

33
00:02:28,214 --> 00:02:33,208
Look. I can be a butter churner,
a typhoid carrier, an apprentice!

34
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:36,152
- I think I'll be an apprentice, Marge.
- What kind of apprentice?

35
00:02:36,256 --> 00:02:38,281
That's for my master to decide.

36
00:02:38,391 --> 00:02:40,689
How about town crier?
You'd be great at that.

37
00:02:40,793 --> 00:02:43,421
<i>- You think so?
- Well, yeah, Dad. You're a big, fat loudmouth...</i>

38
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:45,725
- and you can walk when you have to.
- Aw.

39
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:50,235
Well, if you kids believe in me that much,
I'll give it my best shot.

40
00:03:08,054 --> 00:03:11,455
<i>Dangerous river crossings
threatened life and limb...</i>

41
00:03:11,558 --> 00:03:14,391
<i>but helped our founding fathers
save on bridge tolls.</i>

42
00:03:14,494 --> 00:03:16,394
Excuse me.

43
00:03:16,496 --> 00:03:20,523
I didn't mean to startle you,
but I do love to talkJebediah...

44
00:03:20,633 --> 00:03:22,931
even when I'm drinking
my chicory.

45
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:24,765
I'm the curator,
Hollis Hurlbut.

46
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:28,307
Hi. I'm Lisa Simpson.
I'm here to research a report on Jebediah.

47
00:03:28,408 --> 00:03:30,308
Oh, you're in for a treat.

48
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:33,573
You know, some historians consider
Jebediah Springfield a minor patriot...

49
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,547
but I think you'll find
he's easily the equal...

50
00:03:36,649 --> 00:03:39,447
of William Dawes
or even Samuel Otis.

51
00:03:45,124 --> 00:03:48,821
- Congratulations, Ned. You are our new town crier.
- D'oh!

52
00:03:48,928 --> 00:03:52,921
May your shrill, nasal voice
ring throughout our streets and brains.

53
00:03:53,032 --> 00:03:56,126
Well, thankily-dank, Mayor. I shan't disappoint.

54
00:03:56,236 --> 00:04:00,297
"Har" ye. "Har" ye. I declare myself pickled tink...

55
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:02,374
about Springfield's
bicen-citally...

56
00:04:02,475 --> 00:04:06,309
ti-tin-toodily,
rin-tin-tennial day!

57
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:09,108
You su-diddly-uck, Flanders!
Give me that.

58
00:04:09,215 --> 00:04:11,615
Hear ye! Hear ye!

59
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:15,347
Ye old town crier
proclaimed crappy by all.

60
00:04:15,455 --> 00:04:20,950
Chooseth Homer Simpson,
and he shalt rock thy world.

61
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:23,119
Good God! He is fabulous.

62
00:04:23,229 --> 00:04:26,130
Mmm. He's "embiggened" that role
with his "cromulent" performance.

63
00:04:26,232 --> 00:04:31,534
Top-notch "criering," I admit,
but the hat and bell belong to Flanders. So no dice.

64
00:04:31,638 --> 00:04:33,538
Oh, they're just
family heirlooms.

65
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:36,234
That shouldn't stand in the way
of Homer taking my job and-

66
00:04:36,342 --> 00:04:38,708
Less chat, more hat.

67
00:04:38,811 --> 00:04:40,540
Whoo-hoo!

68
00:04:40,647 --> 00:04:42,740
Hear ye! Hear ye!

69
00:04:42,849 --> 00:04:46,785
The Homer broadcasting system
is on the air!

70
00:04:46,886 --> 00:04:50,219
All hollering, all the time.
I'm gonna make-

71
00:04:50,323 --> 00:04:52,518
You're to restrict your
criering to the parade...

72
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:55,492
- and selected preapproved publicity events.
- Okay.

73
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:02,362
This case holds our most
treasured exhibit:

74
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:05,369
objects owned and used
byJebediah.

75
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:09,430
Here's his fife, upon which he sounded
the sweet note of freedom...

76
00:05:09,542 --> 00:05:12,978
<i>his hatchet, with which he hacked
at the chains of oppression...</i>

77
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:15,445
<i>and his chamber pot.</i>

78
00:05:15,548 --> 00:05:17,448
<i>Wow.</i>

79
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:21,042
Excuse me. My microwave
johnnycakes are ready.

80
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:44,140
"The Secret Confessions
ofJebediah Springfield"?

81
00:05:44,243 --> 00:05:48,737
"Know ye who read this, there is
more to my life than history records. "

82
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:52,215
Firstly, I did not tame
the legendary buffalo.

83
00:05:52,318 --> 00:05:54,343
It was already tame.
I merely shot it.

84
00:05:54,454 --> 00:06:00,256
Secondly, I have not always been known
as Jebediah Springfield.

85
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:06,265
Till 1796 I was Hans Sprungfeld,
murderous pirate.

86
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:09,733
And the half-wits of this town
will never learn the truth.

87
00:06:09,836 --> 00:06:13,363
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!

88
00:06:13,473 --> 00:06:15,634
"Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!"

89
00:06:15,742 --> 00:06:19,041
Oh, my God.
Our town hero is a fraud.

90
00:06:19,145 --> 00:06:22,046
"I write this confession
so that my infamy will live on...

91
00:06:22,148 --> 00:06:26,346
long after my body has succumbed
to my infectious diphtheria. "

92
00:06:26,452 --> 00:06:28,477
Ew.

93
00:06:37,864 --> 00:06:39,832
<i>Here's johnnycakes.</i>

94
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:43,695
Is everything okay?
You look a bit flushed.

95
00:06:43,803 --> 00:06:46,397
Oh, it's just the excitement
of studying Jebediah.

96
00:06:46,506 --> 00:06:49,964
Sounds like you've come down
with a serious case of"Jebeditis. "

97
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:53,568
Just when I was
getting over my Chester A. Arthritis.

98
00:06:55,681 --> 00:06:59,310
- Did-You had arthritis?
- Um, no.

99
00:07:01,487 --> 00:07:05,514
Hear ye. Hear ye. What's for breakfast?

100
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:08,719
- Toast.
- I don't understand thee, Marge.

101
00:07:08,828 --> 00:07:11,388
Hmm. Ye olde toast.

102
00:07:11,497 --> 00:07:13,397
Whoo-hoo.

103
00:07:13,499 --> 00:07:16,332
What would you say if I told you
thatJebediah Springfield...

104
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:18,370
wasn't as great as
he's cracked up to be?

105
00:07:18,471 --> 00:07:23,033
Look. Jebediah was really a vicious pirate
named Hans Sprungfeld.

106
00:07:23,142 --> 00:07:26,873
His tongue was bitten off
by a Turk in a grog-house fight.

107
00:07:26,979 --> 00:07:31,211
No tongue, eh? How did he talk-
and eat and laugh and love?

108
00:07:31,317 --> 00:07:34,184
He had a prosthetic tongue
made out of silver.

109
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:37,051
<i>Yes. That'd do.</i>

110
00:07:37,156 --> 00:07:39,852
He was one of the evilest
men of the 1780s.

111
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:42,018
He even tried to kill
George Washington.

112
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:44,096
The dastard!

113
00:07:48,367 --> 00:07:51,097
- Give me all your money.
- Never!

114
00:08:06,452 --> 00:08:09,114
Ooh! Aaah!

115
00:08:09,222 --> 00:08:11,520
I got the white stars you wanted,
but I couldn't find...

116
00:08:11,624 --> 00:08:14,218
any red hearts, yellow moons
or green clovers.

117
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:17,626
Well, I'll use it,
but I'm not paying for it.

118
00:08:19,198 --> 00:08:21,325
The next time
Hans Sprungfeld was seen...

119
00:08:21,434 --> 00:08:24,426
he had changed his name
toJebediah Springfield.

120
00:08:24,537 --> 00:08:28,200
Lisa, honey.
When my family first came to this state...

121
00:08:28,307 --> 00:08:31,606
they had a choice
of living in Springfield or Stenchburg.

122
00:08:31,711 --> 00:08:33,611
You know why
they chose Springfield?

123
00:08:33,713 --> 00:08:38,377
Because everyone knows Jebediah Springfield
was a true American hero. End of story.

124
00:08:39,986 --> 00:08:42,284
- I believe you, honey.
- You do?

125
00:08:42,388 --> 00:08:45,152
Of course I do. You're always right
about this type of thing...

126
00:08:45,258 --> 00:08:47,283
and for once I want in
on the ground floor.

127
00:08:47,393 --> 00:08:49,486
Oh, thanks, Dad.

128
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:53,931
Ralph. "A."
Janey. "A."

129
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:56,831
<i>And, Lisa, for your-
essay...</i>

130
00:08:56,936 --> 00:09:00,064
"Jebediah Springfield:
Super-Fraud," "F."

131
00:09:00,172 --> 00:09:02,868
- But it's all true.
- This is nothing but...

132
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:05,842
dead-white-male bashing
from a P.C. thug.

133
00:09:05,945 --> 00:09:09,779
It's women like you who keep
the rest of us from landing a husband.

134
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:12,442
Well, nice talking to ya.

135
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:21,692
- Lisa?
- Miss Hoover thought I made the whole thing up.

136
00:09:21,794 --> 00:09:24,422
She called me a P.C. thug.

137
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:27,590
Well, I've been called a greasy thug too,
and it never stops hurting.

138
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,861
So here's what
we're gonna do:

139
00:09:29,969 --> 00:09:34,429
Grease ourselves up real good
and trash that place with a baseball bat.

140
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:38,340
That won't help, Dad.
No one's ever gonna believe me.

141
00:09:38,444 --> 00:09:42,039
But you have proof! We could go
get that confession out ofJebediah's fife.

142
00:09:42,148 --> 00:09:43,877
- We could?
- Come on.

143
00:09:43,983 --> 00:09:46,679
- We can use the baseball bat to smash open the case.
- No baseball bat.

144
00:09:46,786 --> 00:09:47,753
Oh.

145
00:09:49,855 --> 00:09:53,154
- Hi, Mr. Hurlbut.
- Oh, you're back.

146
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:55,159
And you brought a friend.

147
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:57,320
Town crier. I'd like to
ask you a few questions.

148
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:00,297
One: Where's the fife?
And two: Give me the fife.

149
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:04,062
Hey! Stop! I've got nothing but respect
for the office of town crier...

150
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:06,400
but this is well outside
your jurisdiction.

151
00:10:06,505 --> 00:10:09,963
Oh, yeah?
Well, put this in your fife and smoke it.

152
00:10:10,076 --> 00:10:11,634
What the-

153
00:10:11,744 --> 00:10:16,374
That's Jebediah's secret confession.
It proves he was a fraud.

154
00:10:18,084 --> 00:10:21,383
"The Secret Confessions
ofJebediah Springfield. "

155
00:10:21,487 --> 00:10:26,515
Oh. I think, Lisa, that you've been
taken in by an obvious forgery.

156
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:29,891
Unfortunately, historical research
is plagued by this sort of hoax.

157
00:10:29,996 --> 00:10:31,896
The so-called confession...

158
00:10:31,998 --> 00:10:34,626
is just as phony
as the Howard Hughes will...

159
00:10:34,734 --> 00:10:37,726
the Hitler diaries
or the Emancipation Retraction.

160
00:10:37,837 --> 00:10:42,399
<i>But it explains why there's no
record ofJebediah before 1795.</i>

161
00:10:42,508 --> 00:10:44,874
He was Hans Sprungfeld
until then.

162
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:48,310
That's preposterous.
Now get out.

163
00:10:48,414 --> 00:10:51,212
You're banned from
this historical society.

164
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:55,913
You and your children
and your children's children.

165
00:10:56,022 --> 00:10:57,922
For three months.

166
00:11:05,031 --> 00:11:09,730
I'm not gonna give up. I refuse to believe
that everyone refuses to believe the truth.

167
00:11:14,106 --> 00:11:16,904
<i>- I'd like 25 copies on goldenrod-
- Right.</i>

168
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:19,409
<i>- um, 25 on canary-
- Canary.</i>

169
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:21,480
<i>- 25 on saffron-
- Mm-hmm.</i>

170
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:24,879
- and 25 on paella.
- Okay. 100 yellow.

171
00:11:24,984 --> 00:11:26,975
You don't have to
help me with this, Dad.

172
00:11:27,086 --> 00:11:29,987
Oh, sure I do. I always believe
in helpin' the little guy.

173
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:32,489
And you're the littlest guy I know.

174
00:11:32,591 --> 00:11:36,721
- Question. Is your name Ridley Scott orJames Cameron?
- No. It's Homer.

175
00:11:36,829 --> 00:11:40,060
<i>Then I will thank you to stop peering
at my screenplay, Homer.</i>

176
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:42,964
And if I see a movie where computers
threaten our personal liberties...

177
00:11:43,069 --> 00:11:44,969
I will know that
you stole my idea.

178
00:11:45,071 --> 00:11:47,039
I'm just waitin' for my kid.

179
00:11:47,139 --> 00:11:49,573
Mental note. Steal his idea.

180
00:11:52,645 --> 00:11:55,375
Hi, Apu. Can I put this poster
in your window?

181
00:11:55,481 --> 00:11:57,540
Well, of course you can,
you little pixie.

182
00:11:57,650 --> 00:12:00,744
Oh. You're just as sweet as the sticks
which bear your name.

183
00:12:02,154 --> 00:12:04,782
No, no. No, no. No, no, no.

184
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:09,589
Take that down. As a semi-legal immigrant,
your poster could land me in a predicament...

185
00:12:09,695 --> 00:12:11,959
as red hot as the candies
which bear that name.

186
00:12:14,467 --> 00:12:18,028
- He wouldn't let me put it up.
- Okay. Well, that's not gonna stop us.

187
00:12:18,137 --> 00:12:20,731
I know a much better way
to get attention.

188
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,831
Hear ye! Hear ye!

189
00:12:22,942 --> 00:12:26,639
My daughter has something to tell you
aboutJebediah Springfield.

190
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:29,374
Aw, the little cutie
wants to do somethin' cute.

191
00:12:29,482 --> 00:12:32,110
Shut up, ya bums! Shut up!

192
00:12:32,218 --> 00:12:34,686
Go ahead, angel.

193
00:12:34,787 --> 00:12:37,585
Jebediah Springfield was nothing more...

194
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:40,784
than an evil bloodthirsty
pirate who hated this town.

195
00:12:40,893 --> 00:12:43,657
Good God!

196
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:48,029
Homer, you know, I support,
uh, most any prejudice you can name...

197
00:12:48,134 --> 00:12:50,398
but your hero phobia
sickens me.

198
00:12:50,503 --> 00:12:53,870
You and your daughter ain't welcome here
no more. Barney, show 'em the exit.

199
00:12:53,973 --> 00:12:57,602
<i>- There's an exit?
- "Evil bloodthirsty pirate. "</i>

200
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:59,769
Hello.
Town Jubilation Committee?

201
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:02,507
Yeah. I got something that's gonna
make you a lot less jubilant.

202
00:13:05,351 --> 00:13:07,342
Can't you understand,
little girl?

203
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:09,353
Jebediah was no criminal.

204
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:12,185
That's right. The reason they say
he had a silver tongue...

205
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:14,350
is because he was
such a fine speaker.

206
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,724
That's a myth that got mixed up
with the truth.

207
00:13:16,829 --> 00:13:19,525
You are tampering with forces
you can't understand.

208
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:22,328
We have major corporations
sponsoring this event.

209
00:13:22,434 --> 00:13:26,131
I hope you know you're sponsoring
a celebration for a murderous pirate.

210
00:13:26,238 --> 00:13:32,108
A pirate? Well, that's hardly the image
we want for Long John Silver's.

211
00:13:32,211 --> 00:13:34,543
Well, I see no way
of settling this.

212
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:37,343
I say we imprison them
for the duration of our bicentennial.

213
00:13:37,449 --> 00:13:39,883
There is one way.
Get the silver tongue.

214
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:43,250
IfJebediah's who I say he is,
then it should still be in his grave.

215
00:13:43,355 --> 00:13:45,585
Why, that's highly unorthodox.

216
00:13:45,691 --> 00:13:48,182
Yes, but human decency
prevents-

217
00:13:48,294 --> 00:13:51,320
Dig him up! Dig up that corpse!

218
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:54,160
If you really love
Jebediah Springfield...

219
00:13:54,266 --> 00:13:57,861
you'll haul his bones out of the ground
to prove my daughter wrong.

220
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:00,268
Dig up his grave!
Pull out his tongue!

221
00:14:00,372 --> 00:14:04,138
Can't we have one meeting that doesn't end
with us digging up a corpse?

222
00:14:18,757 --> 00:14:21,988
Now, Lisa, when you see there's
no silver tongue in there...

223
00:14:22,094 --> 00:14:24,995
will you stop trying to ruin
Jebediah's reputation?

224
00:14:25,097 --> 00:14:27,361
- Yes.
- What do we win if the tongue is there?

225
00:14:27,466 --> 00:14:29,400
- Credibility.
- Aw. What a gyp.

226
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:42,313
Jebediah Springfield has been
replaced with a skeleton!

227
00:14:42,414 --> 00:14:44,848
No. That's the skeleton
ofJebediah.

228
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:49,512
Gotcha. Gotcha. Okay.
Uh, well, let's start looking for that silver tongue.

229
00:14:49,622 --> 00:14:51,522
Don't forget to look
in his shoes.

230
00:14:51,624 --> 00:14:54,058
When I lose something,
sometimes it turns up in my shoes.

231
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:56,753
Actually, if it's anywhere
it would be lodged in the sinus.

232
00:14:58,864 --> 00:15:03,358
All right. Here goes. Forgive us, Jebediah.
We mean no disrespect.

233
00:15:05,371 --> 00:15:08,238
Well, that settles that.

234
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:11,537
There is no silver tongue,
is there, Bonesy?

235
00:15:11,644 --> 00:15:15,102
Oh, I wish, Chief. With that kind of dough,
I could buy me some eyeballs.

236
00:15:15,214 --> 00:15:17,705
Well, that's the spirit, Bonesy.

237
00:15:17,816 --> 00:15:21,013
- Why don't you sing a song for the nice people?
- All right.

238
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:32,329
I was so sure.

239
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:35,298
- Hear ye. Hear ye. Everybody
makes mistakes. Let's go home.

240
00:15:35,401 --> 00:15:37,392
Not so fast, Simpson.

241
00:15:37,503 --> 00:15:40,131
This foul business
was all your fault.

242
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:44,642
By the power vested in me,
I hereby strip you of your ceremonial bell-

243
00:15:44,743 --> 00:15:47,735
No! No!

244
00:15:47,846 --> 00:15:50,974
<i>and tri-corner hat.</i>

245
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:54,575
You will have the hat cleaned
and then return it.

246
00:16:01,593 --> 00:16:03,493
Oh, Dad.
I'm really sorry.

247
00:16:03,595 --> 00:16:05,790
I know how much
you wanted to be in the parade.

248
00:16:05,898 --> 00:16:07,798
Oh, it's not
your fault, honey.

249
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:10,095
I'm supposed to be
the responsible one.

250
00:16:10,202 --> 00:16:12,830
I shouldn't have let you
let me get carried away.

251
00:16:27,386 --> 00:16:30,014
Why did you dig up
the bones of the past?

252
00:16:30,122 --> 00:16:32,989
Why did you disturb
the ghosts of history?

253
00:16:33,092 --> 00:16:35,720
I- I-

254
00:16:37,262 --> 00:16:39,230
<i>General Washington?</i>

255
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:45,395
You did some good work
exposing Jebediah, Lisa. Don't stop now.

256
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:47,836
There's just one piece left
in the puzzle.

257
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:51,933
But I've caused so much trouble already,
General Washington. I can't go on.

258
00:16:52,044 --> 00:16:54,512
We had quitters
in the Revolution too.

259
00:16:54,613 --> 00:16:56,581
We called them Kentuckians.

260
00:16:56,682 --> 00:17:00,174
Well, I'll just have to find
another little girl to be president.

261
00:17:00,285 --> 00:17:02,276
What's your friend
Janey's number?

262
00:17:02,388 --> 00:17:06,347
No! NotJaney!
She'll pack the Supreme Court with boys!

263
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:10,554
Oh, let me help you, George Washington.
I still want to help you!

264
00:17:10,662 --> 00:17:13,688
I want to help you,
George Washington?

265
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:16,324
Even your dreams are square.

266
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:22,564
Can you open my milk,
Mommy?

267
00:17:22,674 --> 00:17:25,666
I'm not Mommy, Ralph. I'm Miss Hoover.

268
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:40,919
<i>The missing piece of the puzzle.
I've got it.!</i>

269
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:52,203
You? What are you doing here?

270
00:17:52,304 --> 00:17:55,467
I was right aboutJebediah,
and now I can prove it.

271
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:57,474
Oh, please.
Not that claptrap again.

272
00:17:57,576 --> 00:18:00,306
Haven't you hurtJebediah enough
with your childish tales...

273
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:04,542
of pirate ships and fisticuffs
and a silver tongue that can't be found?

274
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:07,312
- That's because you stole it!
- That's a lie!

275
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:11,879
I'm an antiquarian, damn it.
It's my job to seek out the truth.

276
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:14,754
But when you found the truth
you couldn't take it.

277
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:17,693
You couldn't stand that
you devoted your life to a fraud...

278
00:18:17,796 --> 00:18:19,696
so you covered it up,
didn't you?

279
00:18:19,798 --> 00:18:22,528
- Didn't you?
- No. No. That-That's preposterous.

280
00:18:22,634 --> 00:18:25,296
I mean, I- I couldn't.
You-You can't-

281
00:18:25,404 --> 00:18:28,373
Stop it!
Where's the silver tongue?

282
00:18:42,588 --> 00:18:45,113
I thought no one
would ever find it.

283
00:18:45,224 --> 00:18:48,125
When I pried open
the coffin it was there-

284
00:18:48,227 --> 00:18:50,991
<i>that shiny tongue
sticking out ofhis mouth...</i>

285
00:18:51,096 --> 00:18:55,362
<i>razzing my entire career-
my-my life.</i>

286
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:58,925
<i>Before the dust could settle,
I pocketed it.</i>

287
00:18:59,037 --> 00:19:01,597
- But I thought I had you fooled.
- You did.

288
00:19:01,707 --> 00:19:06,110
Until I realized thatJebediah's confession
was saying more than he meant it to.

289
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:10,110
How else could he have
gotten this?

290
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:16,952
Sprungfeld must have taken it
with him when he ran off after the fight.

291
00:19:18,857 --> 00:19:21,951
- Exactly.
- This celebration is a sham.

292
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:24,028
And it's all my fault.

293
00:19:24,129 --> 00:19:27,997
We've got to get the word out to every man,
woman and child in town.

294
00:19:41,313 --> 00:19:43,281
<i>Stop!</i>

295
00:19:43,382 --> 00:19:47,079
<i>Stop everything! Stop the parade.</i>

296
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:50,383
- What?
- What's goin' on here?

297
00:19:50,489 --> 00:19:53,754
- This is highly unorthodox.
- This is Lisa Simpson.

298
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:56,419
She's discovered something
very important...

299
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:59,656
aboutJebediah Springfield
that you need to hear.

300
00:20:02,834 --> 00:20:05,928
People of Springfield,
I, um-

301
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:08,063
I don't know
quite how to say this-

302
00:20:08,173 --> 00:20:12,473
Don't be shy, little girl.
Think ofJebediah, and the words will come.

303
00:20:12,578 --> 00:20:15,979
I did a lot of research on
Jebediah Springfield, and-

304
00:20:16,081 --> 00:20:19,608
- Hmm. I think I can pick her off.
- Wait. Let's see what she has to say.

305
00:20:23,522 --> 00:20:25,080
Jebediah Springfield was-

306
00:20:27,025 --> 00:20:29,118
Jebediah was...

307
00:20:33,432 --> 00:20:35,332
great.

308
00:20:35,434 --> 00:20:38,062
I, um,
just wanted to say...

309
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:41,037
that I've done
some research, and, uh...

310
00:20:41,139 --> 00:20:43,107
he was great.

311
00:20:48,513 --> 00:20:51,243
<i>Yeah.</i>

312
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:53,944
- Well said.
- Great speech!

313
00:20:54,052 --> 00:20:56,043
Jebediah would be
proud of you.

314
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:07,331
- Why didn't you tell them?
- Because the myth ofJebediah has value too.

315
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:09,900
It's brought out the best
in everyone in this town.

316
00:21:10,002 --> 00:21:14,996
Regardless of who said it,
a noble spirit embiggens the smallest man.

317
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:30,452
- Well, hey. It's Homer. Good to see you, nei-
- Get lost.

318
00:21:30,555 --> 00:21:32,887
Hear ye! Hear ye!

319
00:21:32,991 --> 00:21:35,016
Hear ye!

320
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:39,120
He is not the official town crier!
Police, do something!

321
00:21:39,231 --> 00:21:41,927
Well, I'd like to, ma'am,
but he's too damn good.

322
00:21:42,034 --> 00:21:45,800
Let him march, boys.
Let the man march.

323
00:22:02,788 --> 00:22:06,349
<i>It's that team
ofJebediah Springfield</i>

324
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:10,451
<i>Whip them horses
Let them wagons roll</i>

325
00:22:10,562 --> 00:22:14,464
<i>That a people
might embiggen America</i>

326
00:22:14,566 --> 00:22:18,468
<i>That a man might embiggen</i>

327
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:21,471
<i>His soul</i>

328
00:22:21,573 --> 00:22:23,473
<i>- His soul
- Hyah.</i>

329
00:22:23,575 --> 00:22:25,475
<i>His soul</i>

330
00:22:25,577 --> 00:22:27,545
<i>Hyah.!</i>

331
00:22:37,656 --> 00:22:39,556
<i>Hyah.</i>

332
00:22:42,594 --> 00:22:44,562
Shh!

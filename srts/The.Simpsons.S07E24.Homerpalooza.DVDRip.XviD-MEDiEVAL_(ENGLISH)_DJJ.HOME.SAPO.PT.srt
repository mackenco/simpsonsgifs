<i>The Simpsons</i>

2
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:12,478
D'oh!

3
00:00:25,892 --> 00:00:28,326
Whoa.

4
00:00:28,428 --> 00:00:30,328
You know, most of my life I've-

5
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:33,331
I've had to live with the shame
of being a screw-up.

6
00:00:33,433 --> 00:00:38,302
But now, as I stand here with
the award for the district's safest bus driver...

7
00:00:38,405 --> 00:00:41,033
well, i-it's like a dream come true.

8
00:00:41,141 --> 00:00:43,939
<i>- Otto.! Wake up.!
- Huh?</i>

9
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:46,569
<i>Aah!</i>

10
00:00:58,124 --> 00:01:00,024
Aah!

11
00:01:00,126 --> 00:01:03,186
So, um, who's good
at keepin' secrets?

12
00:01:03,296 --> 00:01:08,495
"Dear parents, due to yesterday's unscheduled
field trip to the auto wrecking yard...

13
00:01:08,601 --> 00:01:11,502
"the school bus will be
out of commission for two weeks.

14
00:01:11,604 --> 00:01:13,504
"By reading this letter out loud...

15
00:01:13,606 --> 00:01:16,803
"you have waived any legal
responsibility on our part...

16
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:19,811
in perpetuity, throughout the universe. "

17
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:23,815
Well, we'll have to organize a carpool.

18
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:26,818
Hey! Every day will be like a road trip!

19
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,650
With your dad! To school!

20
00:01:33,293 --> 00:01:35,193
So...

21
00:01:35,295 --> 00:01:37,195
how about those
rainbow suspenders, huh?

22
00:01:37,297 --> 00:01:39,197
Dad-

23
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:42,200
- Pretty cool way to keep your pants up, eh?
- Dad!

24
00:01:42,302 --> 00:01:45,328
I see these kids now with "jive"
printed on their shirts.

25
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:48,703
Now, I can teach you
how you're supposed to say "jive. "

26
00:01:48,808 --> 00:01:51,038
Dad! Please just
drive the car, Dad.

27
00:01:51,144 --> 00:01:53,578
I'm watching the road, sweetie.

28
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,580
<i>"You jive turkey!"
See?</i>

29
00:01:55,682 --> 00:01:57,582
You got to sass it.

30
00:01:57,684 --> 00:02:00,050
<i>"Quit jivin' me, turkey!"</i>

31
00:02:00,153 --> 00:02:01,984
You got to sass it.

32
00:02:02,088 --> 00:02:04,784
A turkey is a bad person.

33
00:02:04,891 --> 00:02:07,792
KFSL- Fossil 103.

34
00:02:07,894 --> 00:02:10,727
Classic hits
from ABBA to Zeppelin, comma, Led.

35
00:02:16,369 --> 00:02:18,098
Tell him!

36
00:02:18,204 --> 00:02:21,196
Uh, Mr. Simpson, sir?

37
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:24,208
Can you please
change the radio station?

38
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:26,710
But this is Grand Funk Railroad.

39
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:29,714
You guys back there
know Grand Funk, right?

40
00:02:32,418 --> 00:02:35,182
Nobody knows the band Grand Funk?

41
00:02:35,288 --> 00:02:38,280
The wild, shirtless lyrics
of Mark Farner?

42
00:02:38,391 --> 00:02:41,656
The bong-rattling bass
of Mel Schacher?

43
00:02:41,761 --> 00:02:44,889
The competent drum work
of Don Brewer?

44
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:46,966
Oh, man!

45
00:02:48,368 --> 00:02:50,268
For more information on Grand Funk...

46
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:52,270
consult your school library.

47
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:07,244
When I listen to a really good song...

48
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:10,254
I start nodding my head,
like I'm saying "Yes!" to every beat.

49
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:12,756
"Yes! Yes! Yes! This rocks!"

50
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:15,259
And then sometimes
I switch it up, like-

51
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:17,886
"No! No! No! Don't stop a-rockin'!"

52
00:03:17,997 --> 00:03:20,124
Dad, please.
You're embarrassing us.

53
00:03:20,233 --> 00:03:24,033
No, I'm not.
I'm teaching you about rock music.

54
00:03:24,137 --> 00:03:27,470
Now, Grand Funk Railroad
paved the way forJefferson Airplane...

55
00:03:27,574 --> 00:03:29,838
which cleared the way
forJefferson Starship.

56
00:03:29,943 --> 00:03:32,673
The stage was now set for
The Alan Parsons Project...

57
00:03:32,779 --> 00:03:34,679
which I believe was
some sort of hovercraft.

58
00:03:34,781 --> 00:03:37,682
Dad, no one cares about any
of your stupid dinosaur bands!

59
00:03:37,784 --> 00:03:41,311
You have the worst,
lamest taste in music ever!

60
00:03:41,421 --> 00:03:44,720
<i>I'm just trying to party with you guys.</i>

61
00:03:44,824 --> 00:03:47,224
Homer, first of all, it's "par-tay"...

62
00:03:47,327 --> 00:03:50,023
and second, we wouldn't
"par-tay" with you...

63
00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:53,223
if you were the last dad on Earth.

64
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:03,406
Hi there. It's been a while
since I set foot in Good Vibrations Music.

65
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:05,977
Where can I find
the latest releases by Bread?

66
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:07,979
- Oldies.
- Oldies?

67
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:10,982
But you've got
all the top bands in here!

68
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:14,679
<i>Styx? I just heard them on
the King Biscuit Flower Hour.!</i>

69
00:04:14,787 --> 00:04:17,688
<i>Now, here are some of
your no-name bands.</i>

70
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:21,886
Sonic Youth? Nine-Inch Nails?
Hullabalooza?

71
00:04:21,995 --> 00:04:24,190
Hullabalooza is a music festival.

72
00:04:24,297 --> 00:04:26,697
The greatest music festival of all time?

73
00:04:26,799 --> 00:04:31,566
There can be only one truly great music festival
a lifetime, and it's the Us Festival.

74
00:04:31,671 --> 00:04:33,969
- The what festival?
- The Us Festival!

75
00:04:34,073 --> 00:04:38,134
Yeesh! It was sponsored by
that guy from Apple Computers.

76
00:04:38,244 --> 00:04:41,111
What computers?

77
00:04:41,214 --> 00:04:43,910
Why do you need new bands?

78
00:04:44,017 --> 00:04:47,350
Everyone knows rock
attained perfection in 1974.

79
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:49,353
It's a scientific fact.

80
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:57,162
Quadraphonic sound, a water bed,
and now a strobe light.

81
00:04:57,263 --> 00:05:00,721
Gentlemen, say hello
to the Second Base-Mobile.

82
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:02,767
Wicked!

83
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,889
<i>Back then
we didn't care what anyone thought...</i>

84
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:27,221
<i>and the chicks
found that irresistible.</i>

85
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:30,888
I think you're cool, Homer Simpson.

86
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:32,897
Sandra, that was mean.

87
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:35,991
<i>But most of all, I remember the music.</i>

88
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:44,039
- What the hell are you two doin'?
- It's called rockin' out.

89
00:05:44,143 --> 00:05:47,044
You wouldn't understand, Dad.
You're not with it.

90
00:05:47,146 --> 00:05:50,877
I used to be "with it. "
But then they changed what "it" was.

91
00:05:50,983 --> 00:05:55,977
Now what I'm with isn't "it,"
and what's "it" seems weird and scary to me.

92
00:05:56,089 --> 00:05:58,455
It'll happen to you!

93
00:05:58,558 --> 00:06:01,686
No way, man.
We're gonna keep on rockin' forever.

94
00:06:01,794 --> 00:06:03,625
Forever. Forever.

95
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:05,630
Forever. Forever.

96
00:06:05,732 --> 00:06:07,461
Forever.

97
00:06:07,567 --> 00:06:09,967
What's wrong, Homie?

98
00:06:12,071 --> 00:06:15,472
I went to the record store today and they
were playing all this music I never heard of.

99
00:06:15,575 --> 00:06:17,770
It was like the store had gone crazy.

100
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:21,870
Hmm. Record stores have always seemed
crazy to me, but it doesn't upset me.

101
00:06:21,981 --> 00:06:23,881
Music is none of my business.

102
00:06:23,983 --> 00:06:25,883
That's fine for you, Marge...

103
00:06:25,985 --> 00:06:29,614
but I used to rock and roll all night
and party ev-er-y day.

104
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:31,622
Then it was every other day.

105
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:36,161
Now I'm lucky if I can find half an hour a week
in which to get funky.

106
00:06:36,262 --> 00:06:39,857
I've gotta get out of this rut
and back into the groove!

107
00:06:39,966 --> 00:06:42,799
Well, good!
Try to include Bart and Lisa.

108
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:47,137
Dear Lord, if you keep Homer
from embarrassing us today...

109
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,800
we promise to build several
churches in your honor.

110
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:51,638
Bart! No!

111
00:06:53,112 --> 00:06:57,310
Hey, wait! I'm okay today!
My mom bought me deodorant!

112
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:59,749
Dad, you forgot to pick up Milhouse.

113
00:06:59,852 --> 00:07:03,686
I did? I must be
getting forgetful in my old age.

114
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:07,248
Open the glove compartment
and fetch me my brain medicine.

115
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,987
What are you talking about?

116
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:15,329
Well? What have we here?

117
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:17,335
Looks like your uncool dad...

118
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:19,769
scored tickets to Hullabalooza!

119
00:07:19,872 --> 00:07:22,306
Bart, these look real.

120
00:07:22,408 --> 00:07:24,808
Check the authenticator spot.

121
00:07:24,911 --> 00:07:27,106
This is an authentic Hullabalooza ticket.

122
00:07:27,213 --> 00:07:29,738
For authentic refreshment,
eat Clark bars.

123
00:07:29,849 --> 00:07:33,216
And for totally outrageous
class rings, it's Jostens.

124
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:35,219
Go, Jostens!

125
00:07:35,321 --> 00:07:37,221
You're not going to school today.

126
00:07:37,323 --> 00:07:40,486
Today your classroom
will be the Capitol City Amphitheater.

127
00:07:40,593 --> 00:07:43,061
Your teacher-
four dozen rock bands.

128
00:07:43,162 --> 00:07:45,562
So get ready for some
well-supervised craziness...

129
00:07:45,665 --> 00:07:48,133
while you rock out
with your father!

130
00:07:48,234 --> 00:07:50,202
Whoo-hoo!

131
00:07:58,211 --> 00:08:00,111
Wow, it's like Woodstock...

132
00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:01,805
only with
advertisements everywhere...

133
00:08:01,914 --> 00:08:03,643
and tons of security guards.

134
00:08:03,749 --> 00:08:06,912
People, have your tickets out.
Throw your cameras out.

135
00:08:07,019 --> 00:08:09,817
Surrender all identification.

136
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:12,985
Ohh!
My homemade Kahlua!

137
00:08:13,092 --> 00:08:18,257
Generation X may be shallow, but at least
they have tolerance and respect for all people.

138
00:08:18,364 --> 00:08:20,423
Hey! A freak show!

139
00:08:26,772 --> 00:08:29,400
<i>Oww!</i>

140
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,409
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

141
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:36,414
And now the band
you've all been waiting for, Cypress Hill!

142
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,717
Before we start-

143
00:08:38,818 --> 00:08:40,718
We have a lost child here.

144
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:43,220
If she's not claimed
within the next hour...

145
00:08:43,322 --> 00:08:45,415
she will become property
of Blockbuster Entertainment.

146
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:58,231
- What is that smell?
- It smells like Otto's jacket.

147
00:09:01,607 --> 00:09:03,438
- Dude, karma.
- What?

148
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:05,443
Karma. Karma.

149
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,843
Oh, I get it.

150
00:09:10,449 --> 00:09:14,078
Dad, you cannot wear that!
That's a Rastafarian hat!

151
00:09:14,186 --> 00:09:17,417
Hey, I been safari-in'
since before you were born.

152
00:09:17,523 --> 00:09:21,926
Wearing a Jamaican hat makes a bold statement
about your connection to reggae music.

153
00:09:22,028 --> 00:09:24,929
Well, excu-u-use me!

154
00:09:27,633 --> 00:09:29,533
You know what, Dad?

155
00:09:29,635 --> 00:09:32,331
Maybe we'll go exploring
on our own for a while.

156
00:09:32,438 --> 00:09:35,839
Well, Homer, this is it.
Time to get back with the people.

157
00:09:35,942 --> 00:09:37,910
<i>The young people.</i>

158
00:09:39,812 --> 00:09:41,712
All right! Yeah!

159
00:09:41,814 --> 00:09:43,611
Cool concert.
Am I right?

160
00:09:43,716 --> 00:09:45,616
- Yeah, nice try, narc.
- Where's the narc?

161
00:09:45,718 --> 00:09:47,709
- Who?
- That fatJamaican guy.

162
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,447
What'd I say?
What's goin' on?

163
00:09:49,555 --> 00:09:54,254
Hey, we're just tryin' to have a good time, narc.
Why do you want to destroy us?

164
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,260
Don't commit your hate crimes here!

165
00:09:56,362 --> 00:09:57,920
Hate crime!

166
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:00,123
Okay, I'm heading out now.

167
00:10:00,232 --> 00:10:02,359
More butt support.
More butt support!

168
00:10:02,468 --> 00:10:04,436
D'oh!

169
00:10:26,192 --> 00:10:28,092
It may be bleak...

170
00:10:28,194 --> 00:10:30,594
but this music is really
getting to the crowd.

171
00:10:30,696 --> 00:10:33,893
Ah, making teenagers depressed
is like shooting fish in a barrel.

172
00:10:39,171 --> 00:10:41,071
Oh!
Makes no sense.

173
00:10:41,173 --> 00:10:45,075
I haven't changed since high school,
and suddenly I'm uncool.

174
00:10:47,179 --> 00:10:49,340
I've been kicked out of paradise.

175
00:10:49,448 --> 00:10:52,440
I'll never be part
of the scene again.

176
00:10:54,787 --> 00:10:56,220
Uh-oh.

177
00:11:03,729 --> 00:11:05,924
Oh, man,
There goes Peter Frampton's big finale.

178
00:11:06,032 --> 00:11:07,932
He's gonna be pissed off.

179
00:11:08,034 --> 00:11:09,934
You're damn right
I'm gonna be pissed off!

180
00:11:10,036 --> 00:11:12,231
I bought that pig
at Pink Floyd's yard sale!

181
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:15,398
- Dad, are you okay?
- I'm fine.

182
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:23,179
Sir, I run Hullabalooza's Pageant
of the Trans-Mundane- the freak show-

183
00:11:23,282 --> 00:11:26,615
and I've been looking for a big fatso
to shoot with a cannon.

184
00:11:26,719 --> 00:11:29,688
I'd like very much
for you to be that fatso.

185
00:11:32,792 --> 00:11:36,990
So, you wanna go on tour
with a traveling freak show.

186
00:11:37,096 --> 00:11:39,496
I don't think
I have a choice, Marge.

187
00:11:39,598 --> 00:11:41,657
- Of course you have a choice.
- How do you figure?

188
00:11:41,767 --> 00:11:44,930
You don't have to join a freak show
just because the opportunity came along.

189
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:47,869
You know, Marge, in some ways...

190
00:11:47,973 --> 00:11:49,873
you and I are
very different people.

191
00:11:55,281 --> 00:11:58,250
<i>And now, get ready for the man...</i>

192
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:01,410
with the iron stomach!

193
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:08,091
Hi, everybody.

194
00:12:09,628 --> 00:12:13,359
Is everybody... good?

195
00:12:26,645 --> 00:12:30,137
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

196
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:38,950
Stay in school.
Your hero, Homer.

197
00:12:40,226 --> 00:12:42,319
Hey, Cannonball.
I like your statement.

198
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:44,828
When life takes a cheap shot at you,
you stand your ground.

199
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:46,522
Billy Corgan,
Smashing Pumpkins.

200
00:12:46,632 --> 00:12:48,827
Homer Simpson, smiling politely.

201
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:51,402
You know, my kids think
you're the greatest.

202
00:12:51,504 --> 00:12:53,404
And thanks to your gloomy music...

203
00:12:53,506 --> 00:12:56,873
they've finally stopped dreaming of a future
I can't possibly provide.

204
00:12:56,976 --> 00:12:58,773
Well, we try to make a difference.

205
00:13:00,146 --> 00:13:01,943
"Dear Bart and Lisa"-

206
00:13:02,047 --> 00:13:03,947
<i>All is well on tour...</i>

207
00:13:04,049 --> 00:13:07,780
<i>with America's most popular
alternative music festival.</i>

208
00:13:07,887 --> 00:13:09,787
<i>Our firstjob is to entertain.</i>

209
00:13:12,892 --> 00:13:17,124
<i>And I like to think sometimes
we get a message across as well.</i>

210
00:13:24,003 --> 00:13:25,903
<i>But the main thing is...</i>

211
00:13:26,005 --> 00:13:28,906
<i>I finally tapped into
that spirit of self-destruction...</i>

212
00:13:29,008 --> 00:13:33,069
<i>that makes rock and roll the king of music.</i>

213
00:13:37,183 --> 00:13:39,242
Whoo-hoo!

214
00:13:41,287 --> 00:13:43,517
Hello, ticket holders!

215
00:13:44,757 --> 00:13:46,657
Oh, here comes
that cannonball guy.

216
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:48,659
He's cool.

217
00:13:48,761 --> 00:13:52,424
- Are you being sarcastic, dude?
- I don't even know anymore.

218
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,071
Thank you!

219
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:06,838
And remember,
don't trust anyone over 30!

220
00:14:06,946 --> 00:14:08,846
And now, Peter Frampton!

221
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:14,812
Thanks, Homer.
Homer Simpson, everyone!

222
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:20,484
Hey, Homer, looks like our next stop
is your hometown, Springfield.

223
00:14:20,593 --> 00:14:23,494
Is it true that we have to
bring our own water?

224
00:14:23,596 --> 00:14:25,496
We got a little rule back home-

225
00:14:25,598 --> 00:14:27,498
If it's brown, drink it down.

226
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,500
If it's black, send it back.

227
00:14:29,602 --> 00:14:31,502
The hometown show's
the big one, Homer.

228
00:14:31,604 --> 00:14:35,096
People who called you a weirdo in high school get
to see what a successful freak you've become.

229
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:37,107
Hey, I wasn't a weirdo.

230
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:39,370
I was in the audio-visual club.

231
00:14:39,478 --> 00:14:41,378
Really? Me too.

232
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:44,381
But I got kicked out
'cause of my views on Vietnam.

233
00:14:44,483 --> 00:14:46,576
Also, I was stealing projectors.

234
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,680
Anyway, get ready, beer belly.

235
00:14:50,789 --> 00:14:54,281
- We're gonna show Springfield what we're made of!
- All right, Homer!

236
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:56,293
<i>Yeah, Homer.!</i>

237
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:59,592
That was odd.

238
00:14:59,698 --> 00:15:01,598
Gee, I don't like
the sound of that.

239
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:04,726
No biggie. I'm cool.

240
00:15:04,837 --> 00:15:08,295
Nothing's more important to me than
the health and well-being of my freaks.

241
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:10,307
I'm sending you to a vet.

242
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:12,468
<i>My God.!</i>

243
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:15,911
Those cannonballs have practically
demolished your stomach.

244
00:15:16,015 --> 00:15:18,916
From now on,
no cannonballs, no spicy foods...

245
00:15:19,018 --> 00:15:21,452
<i>and when you lie
in a hammock, please...</i>

246
00:15:21,553 --> 00:15:24,454
rest your beer on your head
or your genitals.

247
00:15:24,556 --> 00:15:26,456
Rules. I'm a rocker!

248
00:15:26,558 --> 00:15:28,458
I don't care for rules.

249
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,528
Mr. Simpson, this is serious.

250
00:15:30,629 --> 00:15:34,895
If you take one more cannonball
to the gut, you will die.

251
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:39,495
Die?
Well, you don't scare me, Doc.

252
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:44,065
'Cause dyin' would be a stone groove!

253
00:15:44,176 --> 00:15:46,542
Got any messages forJimi Hendrix?

254
00:15:46,645 --> 00:15:49,273
Yes.
Pick up your puppy.

255
00:15:54,987 --> 00:15:57,387
<i>So, what's it like being famous, Dad?</i>

256
00:15:57,489 --> 00:16:00,652
<i>People know your name,
but you don't know theirs. It's great.!</i>

257
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:03,159
Dad, do you wear boxers or briefs?

258
00:16:03,262 --> 00:16:05,162
Nope!

259
00:16:05,264 --> 00:16:07,164
What religion are you?

260
00:16:07,266 --> 00:16:10,758
You know, the one with all the well-meaning
rules that don't work out in real life.

261
00:16:10,869 --> 00:16:13,201
Uh, Christianity.

262
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:16,536
- What's with all the questions?
- Just some report I gotta do for school.

263
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:18,542
- Hey, you want some pie?
- Sure.

264
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:21,204
We've got a lot of catching up to do.

265
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:27,183
Mmm.

266
00:16:43,068 --> 00:16:46,367
Clear the way. Clear the way!
Performer coming through!

267
00:16:46,472 --> 00:16:48,372
This is so exciting.

268
00:16:48,474 --> 00:16:51,807
Last time I got to go backstage was when
Bart ripped his pants at the Christmas play.

269
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:53,878
- Mom!
- Ha-ha!

270
00:16:57,783 --> 00:16:59,683
<i>Hello, bands.!</i>

271
00:16:59,785 --> 00:17:03,482
Who is playing with
the London Symphony Orchestra?

272
00:17:03,589 --> 00:17:07,389
Come on, people. Somebody ordered
the London Symphony Orchestra.

273
00:17:07,493 --> 00:17:09,825
Possibly while high!

274
00:17:09,928 --> 00:17:13,295
Cypress Hill,
I'm looking in your direction.

275
00:17:13,399 --> 00:17:15,299
Hey, man,
did we order an orchestra?

276
00:17:15,401 --> 00:17:18,302
- What's up with this orchestra?
- Where'd the orchestra come from, man?

277
00:17:18,404 --> 00:17:21,305
- I don't know.
- You didn't tell me about this, man.

278
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:23,307
We gotta do somethin'.

279
00:17:23,409 --> 00:17:25,309
Uh, yeah, we think we did.

280
00:17:25,411 --> 00:17:27,311
Uh, do you know
"Insane in the Brain"?

281
00:17:27,413 --> 00:17:31,713
We mostly know classical,
but we could give it a shot.

282
00:17:40,492 --> 00:17:43,120
Now, this I like.

283
00:17:55,474 --> 00:17:57,874
Man, that guy's guitar is talkin'!

284
00:17:57,976 --> 00:18:00,672
Hey, my shoes are talkin' too!

285
00:18:00,779 --> 00:18:02,940
Don't worry.

286
00:18:03,048 --> 00:18:04,948
We won't hurt you.

287
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:08,611
We only want
to have some fun.

288
00:18:10,722 --> 00:18:13,816
And to think, Smithers,
you laughed when I bought Ticketmaster.

289
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:17,589
"Nobody's going to pay
a hundred-percent service charge. "

290
00:18:17,696 --> 00:18:22,929
Well, it's a policy that ensures a healthy mix
of the rich and the ignorant, sir.

291
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:28,328
<i>Do you feel like we do, Springfield?</i>

292
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:32,774
Yeah! Do y-
Wait. Do ya- Do ya feel-

293
00:18:32,878 --> 00:18:36,075
<i>Do- Do ya feel-</i>

294
00:18:36,181 --> 00:18:39,673
Oh, come on!
Do you feel-

295
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:42,379
Homer Simpson wrecks my pig...

296
00:18:42,488 --> 00:18:44,388
Cypress Hill steals my orchestra...

297
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:46,890
and Sonic Youth's in my cooler!

298
00:18:46,992 --> 00:18:48,892
Get out of there, you kids!

299
00:18:48,994 --> 00:18:52,521
Oh, come on, Mr. Frampton.
You're not gonna eat all that watermelon.

300
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:55,657
Please!
I'm trying to perform.

301
00:18:55,767 --> 00:18:58,292
Go ahead.
We'll stay here and guard your cooler.

302
00:19:00,072 --> 00:19:02,404
Twenty-five years
I've been in this- I've never-

303
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:09,038
And now, Springfield, this is the moment
that you've been waiting for!

304
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:13,642
The man who embodies everything
about rock and roll- except the music.

305
00:19:13,752 --> 00:19:17,085
Give it up for your very own
homegrown hero...

306
00:19:17,189 --> 00:19:19,089
<i>Homer Simpson.!</i>

307
00:19:21,527 --> 00:19:23,427
I used to carpool with that guy!

308
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:28,129
Oh, this is heavy.

309
00:19:28,233 --> 00:19:30,633
Okay, Homer,
don't fear the reaper.

310
00:19:30,736 --> 00:19:34,001
Ohh! I'm gonna die!

311
00:19:34,106 --> 00:19:37,007
Cannons are designed to hurt.

312
00:19:37,109 --> 00:19:39,270
They're designed to hurt!

313
00:19:39,378 --> 00:19:41,471
Shh! Mom!
Dad needs our support.

314
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:46,748
You're the coolest dad alive!

315
00:20:14,479 --> 00:20:18,381
Oh, Marge, I thought I had
an appetite for destruction...

316
00:20:18,483 --> 00:20:20,917
but all I wanted
was a club sandwich.

317
00:20:21,019 --> 00:20:23,510
There might be one in this cooler.

318
00:20:23,622 --> 00:20:25,852
- Oh! Here we go.
- Ohh!

319
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:29,553
Oh, man, Homer wussed out.
I'm so disillusioned.

320
00:20:29,661 --> 00:20:32,562
Hey, Hullabalooza isn't about freaks.

321
00:20:32,664 --> 00:20:34,723
It's about music and advertising...

322
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:36,994
and youth-oriented product positioning.

323
00:20:37,102 --> 00:20:40,196
That, and getting toasted.
Nicely toasted.

324
00:20:40,305 --> 00:20:44,105
Homer, I'm sorry. There's nothing worse
than a yellow-bellied freak.

325
00:20:44,209 --> 00:20:46,234
Unless that's his act.

326
00:20:46,345 --> 00:20:49,746
- I expect your letter of resignation on my desk.
- You have a desk?

327
00:20:49,848 --> 00:20:52,248
I mean the hood of my car.

328
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:56,253
I'll miss you Pumpkins,
but I just can't share your bleak worldview.

329
00:20:56,355 --> 00:20:59,256
- I've got too much to live for.
- We envy you, Homer.

330
00:20:59,358 --> 00:21:02,122
All we have is our music,
our legions of fans...

331
00:21:02,227 --> 00:21:04,127
our millions of dollars and our youth.

332
00:21:04,229 --> 00:21:06,891
<i>Whoo-hoo!</i>

333
00:21:06,999 --> 00:21:11,129
- Let's all go out and buy fur coats!
- I want a walk-in humidor.

334
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:18,008
So I realized that being
with my family is more important...

335
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:20,010
than being cool.

336
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:23,013
Dad, what you just said
was powerfully uncool.

337
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:25,015
You know what the song says.

338
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:27,347
It's hip to be square.

339
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:29,352
That song is so lame.

340
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:31,922
So lame that it's... cool?

341
00:21:32,024 --> 00:21:34,185
- No.
- Am I cool, kids?

342
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:36,488
- No.
- Good. I'm glad.

343
00:21:36,595 --> 00:21:39,496
- And that's what makes me
cool- not caring. Right? - No.

344
00:21:39,598 --> 00:21:41,998
Well, how the hell do you be cool?

345
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:44,500
I feel like we've tried everything here.

346
00:21:44,603 --> 00:21:46,503
Wait, Marge.

347
00:21:46,605 --> 00:21:50,439
Maybe if you're truly cool,
you don't need to be told you're cool.

348
00:21:50,542 --> 00:21:53,739
<i>- Sure you do.
- How else would you know?</i>

349
00:22:45,263 --> 00:22:47,231
Shh!

350
00:22:48,231 --> 00:22:58,231
